1795

I view three masters
of the original style...
plum blossom inn


1795

there comes a time
even in blossoming Kyoto...
sick of it


1795

to my upturned face
as I pray, blossoms
drip down


1795

amid his grave's
blossoms I bow...
missing him


1795

distant mountain--
looking at the blossoms
then hurrying on my way


1795

divine providence--
throughout Japan gods
guarding blossoms


1795

peach blossoms and willow
decorate the eaves...
blossom viewing


1795

rain on the eaves--
the potted cherry tree
calm and still


1795

an off-the-cuff haiku
for a poor crop...
mountain cherry blossoms


1795

turning 'round
just missing a pretty woman...
willow tree


1795

Fifth Month rain--
the five thousand five hundredth
rented umbrella


1795

far distance--
above green rice fields
three mountains


1795

the cormorants stare
at them hard...
cormorant fishermen


1795

also changing
into a summer robe...
my journey's lice


1795

my new summer robe
splashed by hot
purification water


1795

for the potted bamboo
and me...
cool air


1795

daybreak--
the rooster-less village
has a cuckoo!


1795

the weary cormorant
sees off the cuckoo
in the sky


1795

temporary shrine--
acting like he owns it
a snail


1795

green plums--
the baddest of bad boys
bare-chested


1795

vast sky
vast earth
autumn passes too


1795

under dewy umbrella-hat
nodding off...
the dog barks!


1795

to Gichu Temple
we run...
first winter rain


1796

their traveling hats
looking small...
mist


1796

birds and people
creeping through...
cherry blossoms


1796

birds on the lake
all start honking...
a cold night


1796

like the others
on tatami mats...
moon gazing


1796

in falling snow
in straw sandals
leaving the inn


1797

becoming a child
on New Year's Day...
I wish!


1797

the grave's soil
welcomes its falling...
winter rain


1798

my New Year's toast
with straw sandals on...
dawn


1798

from the nose
of the sudden riser...
mist


1798

watching rain fall
on the rice seedlings...
from the doorway


1798

crackling in the rainstorm--
field fires
mountain fires


1798

amid mustard flowers
till the ten o'clock bell...
morning tea


1798

plum blossom moon--
descending the ladder
I see it


1798

this morning I'm one
of the pure-minded priests...
plum blossoms


1798

that temple bell
sounds like Ueno's...
clouds of blossoms


1798

the blossom clouds
over Mount Miwa...
pitch black


1798

cherry blossoms--
over there an edge
of Old Japan


1798

cherry blossom clouds--
over there an edge
of Old Japan


1798

in cool air
slicing the falling rain...
lightning!


1798

wind on the greenery--
a weary cloud
hangs over


1798

wind on the greenery--
coming to see my house
the morning sun


1798

in the thick weeds
same as yesterday...
fireflies


1798

while calling fireflies
crossing his profile...
a firefly


1798

in an alley
beating fleas off a mat...
a bright moon


1798

harvest moon--
when my heart's had its fill
it's dawn


1799

leaving now
is especially hard...
spring mist


1799

though Mount Obasute
is hateful...
pure water


1799

evening mountain--
how long will the cold wind
blast?


1799

by the hearth
last night, his smile
was farewell


1800

up to yesterday
I saw you every day...
New Year's herbs


1800

in the blossoms
calling to me clumsily...
a little bird


1800

it seems to wash
the summer mountains...
sunrise


1800

Katsushika--
mostly rice planters
on the ferry


1801

his lock is worthless
he's told...
plowing the rice field


1801

if my father were here--
dawn colors
over green fields


1801

wind shakes the bamboo grass--
mother deer
returns


1801

cuckoo--
today I'm in good spirits
too


1801

shooing flies too
today, as he sleeps
for the last time


1801

night after night
of pestering...
fleas, mosquitoes


1801

at my feet
when did you get here?
snail


1801

splashing me
the survivor...
grassy dew


1802

New Year's pine--
alone, listening to
the evening rain


1802

eye-catching
over the sunset mountain...
a kite


1802

the hairdresser's
white wooden clogs...
spring moon


1802

a river of broth
is steaming...
spring moon


1802

from the temple's
noon bath rising...
spring mist


1802

heat shimmers--
snow in the little thicket
winking


1802

ice melting--
in the threshold
early evening's moon


1802

behind me I hear
the Fox Festival...
Ueno Hill


1802

no Fox Festival ruckus
on this hill...
plum blossoms


1802

Fox Festival--
what village is this
in the mountain's nook?


1802

below the nightingale's
chin...
Awaji Island


1802

today they're flying
in the bathhouse town...
swallow swarm


1802

stopping to watch
the evening pines...
geese flying north


1802

darkening dusk--
in one nettle tree
croaking frogs


1802

a meadow butterfly
bombarded by big raindrops
from the eaves


1802

flecked with sand
from the whirlwind...
little butterfly


1802

rain shower--
yesterday at this time
meadow butterflies


1802

someone's draped them
over the azaleas...
bracken


1802

one branch makes
Kyoto's sky...
plum blossoms


1802

like old times--
plum blossoms here and there
evening's wooden drum


1802

cherry blossoms scatter--
the servant Taro
is relieved


1802

holding up
the hazy moon...
willow tree


1802

the main road
dry from drought...
midsummer


1802

pitter-patter rain--
a wild cormorant mother
cries on a branch


1802

from my bed
I peek outside...
new summer robes


1802

that one by itself
is my star...
Milky Way


1802

in the bamboo grove
too late at night!
pounding cloth


1802

the snipes too
tired of standing...
treeless hill


1802

gradually the geese
pass on...
rice field moon


1802

rain on the beach
stamping out
the wood fire


1803

removing my skullcap--
at everywhich gate
spring blossoms


1803

even at my penned-in
house...
spring blossoms


1803

"Spring begins"
just saying it...
green everywhere


1803

stretching his neck
the turtle waits too...
the year's first day


1803

even in our faces
the year's first dawn...
the emperor's pine


1803

ending the Servants' Holiday
on purpose...
sliver moon


1803

under a clear sky
on a mountain...
year's first archery


1803

at dawn
I start the spring...
borrowed clothes


1803

begging actors
play one more song!
spring snow


1803

the gruel cauldron
all clean and ready...
herbs in the field


1803

a tree stump at the edge
of his holy face...
picking herbs


1803

in the bamboo basket
only a bit, of course...
New Year's herbs


1803

into my sleeve
fresh-picked New Year's herbs...
Sumida River


1803

the rooster also sings
to Great Japan...
on the rice cake mill


1803

scattering onto
my purple sleeves...
spring snow


1803

Kitasaga--
in evening rain
a pestle from olden times


1803

at my dinner tray
a sparrow chirps...
spring rain


1803

spring rain--
elsewhere the shrines
are wonderful


1803

a crow's feather
on the toasted rice cake...
spring rain


1803

spring breeze--
though deep in the grasses
my home village


1803

seeing Kyoto
I massage my shins...
spring mist


1803

on horseback
making a silent bow...
thin mist


1803

heat shimmers--
having lost a child
the bird's face


1803

melting snow--
at the foot of the mountain
a festival!


1803

saved from the fire
a nest in its beak...
the crow moves on


1803

when the nightingale
moves into the pine...
voice of the pine


1803

nightingale singing--
to the south a goose
clacking


1803

pine islands--
which one's good for sleeping
evening lark?


1803

evening lark--
which pine island's
your sleeping place?


1803

the dawn moon in raindrops
from the eaves...
the geese depart


1803

eating my rice
by lamplight...
the geese depart


1803

all eager to see
Mount Sarashina...
departing geese


1803

the rice field geese
all head north...
a lucky spring day


1803

geese flying north--
the stage barn's lamplight
in mist


1803

departing geese
what are you
gabbing about?


1803

departing geese
over Hokuroku Road
departing


1803

on the day of departure, too
she leads...
the widow goose


1803

the gateway's lamp
in mist...
the geese depart


1803

rain-drenched grass
moon in the pine...
the geese depart


1803

a fleeting moonlit
wedding night...
frogs singing


1803

even in the well bucket
croaking all night...
a frog


1803

while croaking he jumps--
frog in the rainy
grass


1803

picking mulberry leaves--
the baby on her back
stretches a hand


1803

with thin arms
stripping mulberry leaves...
night rain


1803

how many people
waiting for evening?
wisteria in bloom


1803

it seems likely
someone's at home...
plum blossoms


1803

plum trees bloom
nightingales sing...
all alone


1803

plum moon--
facing the blossoms
sewer water


1803

a branch of blooming plum
awaits the thief...
evening


1803

don't let the plum blossom guard
cut your tongues...
sparrows!


1803

waiting so long
for just one branch...
plum blossoms


1803

in Katsushika
how many connoisseurs!
plum blossoms


1803

at his house
though he's dirt-poor...
plum blossoms


1803

laying my hands on them
suddenly, a face...
plum blossoms


1803

guarding a house
with no live coals...
plum blossoms


1803

the owl
sees them first...
plum blossoms


1803

among the pines
all alone
a plum tree blooms


1803

tis the season
for taking a wife...
plum blossoms


1803

a harsh rain
falls at noon...
blossoming mountain


1803

off to one side
they're breath-taking...
blossom viewing


1803

an old man's
flattering laughter...
blossom shade


1803

blossom clouds--
the loyal retainers
of Old Japan


1803

evening--
a bird of prey flies home
into blossoms


1803

by tomorrow
one mountain left...
cherry blossoms

an ancient cherry tree
in bloom...

for the strange village
a prayer...
peach blossoms


1803

green willows
are the first thing seen...
Sumida River


1803

from here on
it's Great Japan!
willow trees


1803

it's still
a Sixth Month sky...
summer's last day


1803

short summer night--
at the gate a happy
nettle tree


1803

short summer night--
a deer pokes his face
through the fence


1803

such cool air!
just ankle-deep
the little river


1803

from the treetop
gliding into midsummer...
bright moon


1803

tucking me in
they cover my lap...
midsummer clouds


1803

the house has become
one heap of ivy...
Fifth Month rain


1803

in Fifth Month rain
hidden by bamboo...
farmhouse


1803

Fifth Month rain--
the second floor room
has wildflowers!


1803

even the branches
viewed from the second floor...
Fifth Month rain


1803

on the river's bank
already it's a moonlit night...
billowing clouds


1803

billowing clouds--
have the pine trees
shrunk a bit?


1803

emerging under
the peaks of clouds...
a little boat


1803

for the moment
straight above my pillow...
billowing clouds


1803

a vast river island
gone without a trace...
summer moon


1803

a so-called "summer moon"
one night
two nights...


1803

a big crop
for my neighbor's pear tree...
summer moon


1803

the scrawny pine, too
looks extravagant...
summer moon


1803

finally a clear sky
yet no moon...

1803

summer mountain--
with each step more
of the sea


1803

a rumble of thunder
in my empty stomach...
summer field


1803

the shallow well
loses its finery...
picking summer flowers


1803

in the outcastes' village
easily overlooked...
summer banners


1803

behind the night fishing
light
in a grove


1803

rain showers
to the north and east...
fishing the night river


1803

the great lord
does the brushing...
horse's sweat


1803

chewing the side
of her candy stick...
summer kimono


1803

my everyday umbrella-hat
doesn't match it...
summer kimono


1803

seeing the green mountain
for the first time...
ladies with parasols


1803

I see Mokubo Temple
I see ladies
with parasols


1803

gate after gate
the rain has cleared...
green bamboo blinds


1803

wind blows--
lots of rips, my so-called
mosquito net


1803

his starched summer
robe his blanket...
siesta


1803

entrusting it
to the green willow...
my paper fan


1803

in morning shadows
he passes through the barrier gate...
with paper fan


1803

sweeping off three drops
of rain in passing...
paper fan


1803

moon on the sea--
he's under his fan
sleeping


1803

my old face rests
in morning-glories...
fanning my paper fan


1803

holding
such a pretty fan...
the widow


1803

downwind, an orchid
in moonlight...
smudge pot smoke


1803

descending Mount Fuji
blow! blow!
smudge pot smoke


1803

pounding rice cakes
to the west, to the east
smudge pots


1803

holding a lantern
tidying up...

1803

in the foot-tall bamboo
night after night...
cool air


1803

speak of the devil!
a snipe takes flight...
evening cool


1803

one tree
one farmer's field...
evening cool


1803

even if I touch her
this tree rejects me...
evening cool


1803

planting a pine too
for after I die...
evening cool


1803

if you get too close
the nettle tree will curse you!
evening cool


1803

pine sapling--
before long, strangers enjoy
evening's cool


1803

going too far
into the thick of thorns...
evening cool


1803

keeping her appointment
to enjoy evening's cool air...
moon at the gate


1803

brazen with people
who come and go...
fawn


1803

lingering
under the paper umbrella...
a fawn


1803

dawn--
from atop the wheat
"cuckoo!"


1803

on a low branch
a child's imitation...
mountain cuckoo


1803

so is haiku hell
over that-a-way...
mountain cuckoo?


1803

from the fir tree too
two are singing...
mountain cuckoos


1803

reed thrush--
the cow doesn't answer
his question


1803

lit by the mosquito-murdering
taper...
my white hair


1803

a mosquito
all day it whines...
by my pillow


1803

left out all night
the tofu gleams...
mosquitoes whisper


1803

swatting a fly
looking at
a mountain


1803

the grasses' fleas
pitter-patter move...
lamplight's shade


1803

while the floating island
moves along...
cicada chorus


1803

the moonflowers
strike it rich!
the stars


1803

moonflowers--
one by one the wind
rustles them


1803

heat shimmers
on top of heat shimmers...
poppies


1803

the tall pines
end up sunburned
O poppies!


1803

from the day they bloomed
drenched by rain...
poppies


1803

among the footprints
of the warriors...
poppies


1803

the gatekeeper's
side-field...
let the poppies bloom!


1803

at dawn
not a soul in sight...
lotus blossoms


1803

in the white lotuses
two or three strands
of willow


1803

even in the mouth
of the gutter pipe...
lotuses


1803

the scent of lotuses
in the back
house on a hill


1803

against the mountain pine
they're blown...

staring at me
on and on...
toad in the lilies

for barley harvesters...

show no mercy...

1803

just when the young bamboo
starts to straighten...
lightning


1803

also running late--
my garden's
eggplants


1803

growing where
the seedling seller passed...
first eggplant


1803

one more day
of leafy shade for you...
eggplant


1803

on the gate's post
where the pony is tied...
fresh green leaves


1803

for the second day
the same big snake...
thick summer grasses


1803

every day
four or five fall...
Sleeping Tree's blossoms


1803

the green plum
also accepts the feeling
of the ant


1803

groping for plums--
the frog on the branch
is magnanimous


1803

autumn cold--
wherever I go people
have homes


1803

paying no heed
to morning's cold...
shoots of rice


1803

he checks the bamboo
with concern...
morning cold


1803

beating the empty
straw bag--nothing!
a cold night


1803

while leaning on it
it's turned chilly...
the post


1803

alone he cries
the motherless bird...
autumn dusk


1803

even the pine tree
I planted grows old!
autumn dusk


1803

"It's a foolishly long
night!" I say
in the long night


1803

the pine wind
blows in my ear...
a long night


1803

Milky Way--
maybe the fools of Kyoto
are crying


1803

a cloud zigzags
above where I lie...
Milky Way


1803

a clear view
in the soup kettle...
Milky Way


1803

some places up there
look deep...
Milky Way


1803

where will my star
stop for the night?
Milky Way


1803

the defeated wrestler, too
joins the crowd...

up in that sky...
for foreigners, too!

there's water
beyond the stubble...
clear fall weather

my knees

the pony leaves
his home village...

one sleeve...

on my knees...

on four or five
slender blades of grass

looks rustic...

the autumn wind
blows as if it knows
I'm an orphan


1803

two leaves of radish
rejoice!
autumn wind


1803

one by one
everyone has left...
autumn wind

shining up
the evening moon...
autumn wind

humidity--
from beneath a stone
wildflowers


1803

humidity--
even one blade of grass
is autumn


1803

clinging to the lord's
umbrella-hat too...
evening dew


1803

a wrinkled face
he's my age...
lanterns for the dead


1803

Bon lanterns--
yesterday's tiles
today are weeds


1803

stopping to watch
three, two...
lanterns for the dead


1803

in pine-tree shade
the one who doesn't dance
ivory white


1803

the sound of oars
lingers...
good stars tonight


1803

for the fisherman's
rising smoke too...
good stars tonight

are male

even the scarecrow
turns his back to it...
my home


1803

sound of river
sound of bird clapper...
daybreak is near


1803

favoring
Mount Akahage...
distant cloth-pounding


1803

in one ear a bell
on the ridge, someone pounding cloth
in the evening


1803

pounding cloth
in the night...
rain on the nettle tree


1803

her mouth and hands
not like everyone's...
evening cloth-pounding

the flood was exactly
a year ago...
evening cloth-pounding

the lord of Sarashina's
buckwheat fields...
evening cloth-pounding

Sarashina--
in a dark direction
evening cloth-pounding


1803

this afternoon in Suma
autumn begins...
distant cloth-pounding


1803

dangling from
the young buck's antler
weeds


1803

the little crow
is snubbed...
rice field geese


1803

another year
they're back for the massacre...
rice field geese


1803

flying south
for the slaughter?
celestial geese


1803

a new face
in the flock...
rice field geese


1803

when you return
don't forget my house!
departing swallows

"The world of man
and me are good!"
locusts fly


1803

after a wasted night
the rain falls...
katydid


1803

today again
death draws nearer...
the wildflowers


1803

their many colors
fade so soon...
chrysanthemums


1803

morning-glories
blooming thick...
someone else's house


1803

morning-glories
utterly drenched...
a passing rain


1803

pine's ivy--
after leaves turn red
cut down


1803

Sir Horse's fart
wafting over...
blooming bush clover


1803

the divine wind
blows a blessing...
spears of rice


1803

a big pig
sticks out his face...
blooming rushes


1803

downstream, the gate
to knowledge...
evening's red leaves


1803

treading untrodden
earth to see...
evening's red leaves


1803

people have gone
lanterns have died...
one leaf remains


1803

it's all yours
butterfly, take a rest
on the mushroom


1803

keeping his cool
under a Twelfth Month moon...
nettle tree


1803

a traveler's sky--
Twelfth Month
29th day


1803

even from falling rain
stabbing
cold


1803

palms
in the cooking smoke

smells burnt

on the neighbor's house
where smoke rises...

with a little lantern

in the palm of my hand...

in a rotten mood

and smoke...
over withered fields

of my neck, setting sun
and hibachi

elsewhere

once again
I've managed not to die...

my spring--
a bit of bamboo
and a willow sprig


1804

spring begins--
forty three years
fed by strangers


1804

spring begins--
in Yoshino the faces
of fools


1804

without a shred
of pine decoration...

untouched by the spring breeze...

on Mount Mutsu

the pine saplings
over shoulder-high...
spring breeze

walking in mist
in a little sedge hat
with both parents

the mist wrecks my view
of the women

without pine trees...
lonelier still


1804

at Sumiyoshi
all through the low tide...

1804

waited so long
for the low tide...
a driving rain

with a rooster crowing...

for the nesting bird!

singing skylark
where is this poor village's
border?

the lark sings
as it flies along...
Great Japan!

my home village
no longer in sight...

someone on the tideland
a lark singing


1804

evening lark
don't let the field's smoke
annoy you


1804

mingling
with the thunder--
a pheasant's cry


1804

a pigeon cries--

celebrate the morning rain
then off you go!

the last in line
hits the rain...
departing geese

departing geese
where will you moon-gaze
tomorrow?

the departing goose
stares the man
in the face

is at Mount Sarashina!"
the goose departs

with oil lamps...

in his mouth and eyes...

from the twig

with these violets?

by raindrops from the eaves...

for calling fireflies...
planting a willow

from where a fence
pens it in...
a willow

three strands or so
hide in the pine...

in soup kettle
and outhouse

looking at tomorrow's mountain
lying down

the moon shines
up to the pine...
pure water gushes

appears again

even trying on my summer kimono
lonely...

entering my ramshackle
hut you see...
a parasol

only through the window...

1804

after trying out
the twice-fired sake...

for one man alone...

a bamboo flute
Kamakura-style, rice planters
in umbrella-hats

his face older
than the pine...

even living
in Katsushika...
"cuckoo!"


1804

Sumida River
even more old-timey...
"cuckoo!"


1804

amid the thunder's
rumble...
a reed thrush singing


1804

O reed thrush
which road is the dead end
of Kasai?

from branches that block
the wind...

completes the scene...

by a sewer

burn anciently...

going out
to get soup stock...

1805

on Musashi Plain
complementing a house...

almost a harvest moon
burning pine needles...
Saga Field


1805

in some sky
rain isn't falling...
harvest moon night


1805

rain falling, too
on Sumida's river beach...
harvest moon night


1805

after renting the house
the first thing: moon gazing
twice


1805

after renting the house
moon-gazing there...
twice


1805

a big rain--
on the moon-gazing boat
watching it fall


1805

tonight's moon--
I, too, am staying
in Musashi!


1805

growing old--
even while moon gazing
praising Buddha!


1805

Ninth Month moon--
in the mountain's shade
a food festival


1805

rain, rain!
on the 13th night
of Ninth Month


1805

the mountain's blooming
buckwheat hides it...

no fear
of autumn rain's downpour...

he rakes pine needles
for tomorrow's tea, perhaps...

blowing! blowing! night...

autumn wind--
topping the grasses
someone's face


1805

reaching the face
of Buddha in his niche...
autumn wind


1805

water splashed
on the stone, on the tree...
autumn wind


1805

each time I look
autumn wind is blowing...
Edo's sky


1805

the morning fog
tangled
in the willow


1805

over one thicket
a custom-made shroud...
evening fog


1805

autumn mountain--
is he banging that gong
because he's alive?


1805

autumn mountains
one by one
the evening falls


1805

at my feet
sunset's rays, autumn
mountain


1805

bird sings again
bell tolls again...
autumn mountain


1805

in people's faces
the same darkness...
autumn mountain


1805

up to my doorway
the autumn field blooms...
rainy day


1805

at my ramshackle hut, too
night is cool...
lanterns for the dead


1805

almost cold
drenched in grass...
lanterns for the dead


1805

the pine breeze too
blows carefully...
lanterns for the dead


1805

at the hermit's hut, too--
an upturned face awaits
the stars


1805

awaiting the stars--
even a turtle cools
his behind

lined up perfectly
with the pine...

a rush of red leaves
blown against him...

here too, three or four
cloth-pounders

rising smoke
towering pine, then...
cloth-pounding


1805

the owl comes
to lend a hand...
cloth-pounding

remote province--
even in the haunted field
pounding cloth


1805

I leave my chrysanthemum
for the evening...
fresh-brewed sake


1805

high tide--
splish-splash
goes the buck


1805

the young buck
tries to hide
in bush clover


1805

do you think you're hiding
in that bush clover?
face of a deer


1805

this mountain rain
and the deer's tears
must be mingling


1805

only after the woodpecker
flies...
back in my hut


1805

the woodpecker returns
to the pine...
now I'm old


1805

the woodpecker works
one spot...
all through sunset


1805

the woodpecker
pecks it to death...

you too have adapted to life
in Edo

katydid--
"katy-katy!" not dead
yet


1805

not a thicket
for a katydid's singing
in sight


1805

even in the barn's shade
if there's grass
there's autumn blooms


1805

even in the sky
Buddha dwells...
wildflowers


1805

blocking the gate--

into morning-glories
with one shoulder bare...

and loads of children...

1805

lost
in the morning-glories

droplets forming
on the morning-glories...
sitting still


1805

in morning-glories
a chill chilling
my spine


1805

in the morning-glories
warming up...
the cold


1805

morning-glories
even in sewer mud
a morning scene


1805

selling morning-glories
wet with morning dew...
a tough character


1805

voice of the bell--
the morning-glories are the first
to stir


1805

on the busy gate, too
morning-glories
bloom


1805

my house's pitiful
morning-glories, too
greet the dawn

on one branch
tumbling head over heels...

have passed their season...

on peaks, in valleys
all the way to Takaya

even the willow
is lonely...
rose of Sharon


1805

night after night
a good wind blows...
roses of Sharon


1805

the moon emerges
'round a curve...
the gourd


1805

all the mountains
are looking old...
gourds


1805

with the emptiness
of bare trees...
this year ends


1805

for me and the pine
this damned year, too
ends


1805

its mouth open
waiting for spring?
paper dog


1805

waiting for spring
sparrows also make a home
in the bamboo


1805

year's end--
the bell of my death place
tolls too

year's end--
when will my turn come

just existing
I exist...

passing

hurry along!
in nighttime hail
on wooden clogs

expecting a night
of spring...

pounding rice cakes
gliding into evening...

the holy man's goose, too
alive and well

at night a sound
like rice cake pounding...
the nettle tree


1805

at my gate
the usual evening rain...
pounding rice cakes

come, come, snow!
the young pine needs
new clothes

bell of old age...
listen!

falconry--
a barley field's rising sun
on one sleeve


1805

plain, light-blue
skullcaps...
sprinkled in


1805

in a flash my home's
dressed to the nines...
morning's charcoal fire


1805

every evening
you're also more depleted...

is nil

by the wood fire
comparing our wrinkles...
Mount Kagami


1805

banked fire--
gulls clamor
in the redbud tree


1805

banked fire--

at my pillow

the red leaves too
fall like tears

even for winter's withering
an indifferent face...

another year
just taking up space...

is all decked out...

hear the begging actors?

sky turns dark...

on an ancient road...

per person

through a window big
as an umbrella-hat...

drying

drink sake!

on Doll's Day

and arrives...

when you come

are elsewhere

entrusting the thicket
to the field crow...

Mount Ashigara's
mountain pheasant,
celebrate the haze!


1806

hilltop pheasant
are you jealous of the heron's
style?

around noon, squawking
the pheasant walks
through town

even in mountain shade
a plowed field!
the pheasant cries

geese fly north--
how they yearn to see

by sight, are they gone?

is unsanctioned!"

west toward Matsuhara
crawls

casting a spell
on the man...

in the thicket no one
knows about
trees budding bright

springtime
yet it blooms reluctantly...
the camellia


1806

my home village--
even lying-down cows
look at camellias


1806

in plain old everyday
plains and fields...
plum blossoms!


1806

may the wind send
this plum blossom scent
to Kyoto!


1806

plum blossom scent--

with a song


1806

wrapped in the scent
of plum blossoms...

1806

plum blossom scent--
through a needle's eye
the light

smell nice...
plum blossoms

on plum blossoms

1806

scattering blossoms--
today too
like olden times


1806

up close
even the cherry blossoms of Ueno
pass on


1806

cherry blossoms--
I also hear a temple bell
from my twenties


1806

in cherry blossom shade
there are even those
who hate this world


1806

from now on
cherry blossom solitude!
my window


1806

on Mount Ubasute
where the old were left to die...
cherry blossoms


1806

most end up
stuck in mud...
cherry blossoms

the moon shining--
no carousing
this summer night!

for each little village
one little hill


1806

evening cool--
a Buddha of healing
in a thicket


1806

in a cloudburst
another festival shrine
passes by


1806

rainstorm--
hanging over the village
that doesn't pray


1806

rainstorm--
a wildflower blooms
at my pillow


1806

only when a scrap of cloud
billows to form peaks...
then to bed


1806

when I go back to sleep
it quickly forms peaks...
little cloud


1806

at my humble hut, too
celebration smoke
for green rice fields


1806

an arm for a pillow
imagining the green rice field
is mine

have bloomed!

when you step one foot
on the mountain...
mountain cuckoo

my hut's firefly
still hasn't starved
to death


1806

skinny firefly
on the big boat's mast
clinging


1806

my house
where the town's fireflies
hide out


1806

my gate--
lodging for the fireflies
there being no grass


1806

in my thicket
at the end of their time...
fireflies


1806

a thing to celebrate!

feast on me too

mosquitoes

while swatting a fly
today again...

sharing the sunset
with the pony...

grow old

bloom!

is fruitless too...
my life

the blooming pink
rallies its spirits...

isn't

mountain village--
a cold night's
night walker

up my spine...

yet another traveler
overtakes me...

children
on autumn's last day...
a ruckus!


1806

taking no notice
of such a moon...
little house


1806

on a soot-grimed
straw mat too...
moon gazing


1806

autumn wind--
a face used to its blast
in his mountain home

behind me
the autumn wind blows
me home

under which star
is my home?
autumn wind

morning-glories shiver
as they sprout...
an autumn gale blows


1806

soon enough
for the murderer too...

1806

dewdrops forming--
on the hill, of course
smoke rising

dewdrops on the grass
at first so happy!
so cool!

in beads of dew
one by one my home
village

the horse's tears?

once upon a time
he was the champ...

scarecrows standing--
a house without rice cakes
can't be found


1806

the pine saplings
looking pretty...
a scarecrow


1806

facing my way
in the cold rain...
a scarecrow


1806

that farmer
draining his rice field...
lonely too?


1806

the rice field guard
also watches...
water drains away

in Yoshino's
ancient night...
someone pounding cloth

rice field geese--
not a single voice
sounds old

once they settle down
another clamor...

and so the geese
are honking

geese honking
hasten the evening...

morning-glories--
they also aren't tired
of blooming

morning-glories
on the saw scrap heap
bloom


1806

is that dew
the horse's tears?
rice blossoms

even where the puppy
sleeps...

for the young buck...

of Sharon

pissed on by the horse...
shiny new

a frozen bell clangs
on the mountain out back
at bedtime


1806

marking the end
of another year...
snowfall

comparing my wrinkles
with the pickled plums...

and live with me...

up to last year

frost on the grass
this damned year, too
the trampling begins

facing a house
without sake...
night frost


1806

here and there
eggplants dangle too...
withered fields


1806

all sorts of fools
moon-gaze too...
winter prayers


1806

ashamed--
eating then going to bed
I hear the winter prayers

all the tea at hand
I unseal...

in Katsushika
they dump soot there too...

the Twelfth Month singers
don't turn around and look...

unfold, here comes

growing old well?

1806

"Great Japan!"
join the snow sled song
sparrows

the plum tree too
is soon snowed in...

1806

early winter seclusion--
whose thin smoke
over there?


1806

winter seclusion--
the wild geese labor
till evening


1806

for three months
my winter seclusion...
old age


1806

wild boar--
it looks like you just
woke up


1806

wind blows--
the wild boar's sleeping face
so innocent


1806

trampling my house
to pieces, are you?
flock of plovers


1806

winter hay
and smoke from tea grounds...
sweet nostalgia


1806

why so slow
withering?
little thicket's hedge


1806

lacking good sense
out-of-season flowers
on the fence


1807

even on New Year's Day
around here Edo
is countrified


1807

for the turtle too
it's the First Month
first day


1807

may the gods grant
prosperity!
the emperor's spring


1807

spring begins--
I send up my smoke
like everyone else


1807

at my gate
the artless pigeon too
sings "It's spring!"


1807

even the smoke
rises anciently...
spring begins


1807

with no cards or letters
spring has begun...
thatched house


1807

"Spring's begun"
I say then see

the trainer lets
his monkey hold it...

sound of a loom--
hidden in bamboo
a New Year's kite


1807

sleeping through New Year's
dreaming of plum blossoms
probably

for the turtle on a rock
it's the usual
long day

the back gate
opens on its own...
a long day


1807

the chicken stares
at the man...
a long day


1807

in the owl's opinion
every day
is long


1807

spring snow
on my narrow sleeves...
clinging


1807

spring snow sprinkles
the earth god's
festival song


1807

my home village--

with spring snow


1807

going to see
Mokubo Temple's evening...

whistles through...

1807

in spring's breeze
clutching chopsticks
the sleeping child


1807

over rice cakes and jelly
the good spring breeze
blows

the meal at the mountain's foot
marvelous


1807

through heat shimmers

rain

heat shimmers--
in that hole perhaps?

from a peach tree gathering
low tide shells

threshing tea--
leaves fly at a fat sparrow's
face too


1807

sowing seeds to the edge
of the kettle's soot-pile...
herbs


1807

the blessed priest
won't see it in his next life...

1807

at my gate
the crow laughs
at the branch I grafted


1807

begging
for a wife!

nestling--
even when people come
opening its mouth

he's off to make a living alone...

1807

after the nightingale drinks
water is drawn...

what don't you know
about people?

through a gap
in the cloths for sale...

is parched

getting used to drinking
the horse's water...
a pheasant


1807

a pheasant crying
the old woman's plot of wheat, too
all green


1807

a pheasant cries--
burnt black yesterday
this ancient pine

the pheasant's cry sounds
half-hearted...
spring begins


1807

giving these skinny legs
new life...
a pheasant

the traveling geese
check it out thoroughly...

wanders


1807

from the tub in the reeds
a croaking
frog


1807

next to my shadow
that
of a frog


1807

frogs croaking
the nights becoming
shorter


1807

in leafy shade
an old man's voice...
a frog!


1807

in leafy shade
gazing at the camellia...

1807

"Come see
the crappy house at night!"
croak the frogs


1807

an evening frog
in rainy weeds sings
of old age


1807

at my gate
the hoarse frog
keeps singing

a butterfly on the wet
horse's leg
now and then, sleeps

in the next life don't
be like me

the horse gazes
at plum blossoms


1807

for the pony
it's a neck-scratcher...
blooming plum


1807

the thicket's edge
blooming on the sly...
plum trees


1807

glaring at the newcomer
with his umbrella...
blossom shade


1807

like the sky
over Katsushika...
clouds of blossoms


1807

cherry blossoms--
I've been living in Edo
for this day!


1807

rain of cherry blossoms--
this year, too
I've sinned


1807

cherry blossom shade--
"That was good thunder!"
he says


1807

cherry blossom clouds--
leaving Edo
tomorrow


1807

are here


1807

for the poor
there's not a spring
without blossoms!

even in falling rain
satisfied faces...

1807

behind me a dog
growls his distrust...
cherry blossoms!


1807

bells and big drums
all stop...
cherry blossoms


1807

cherry blossom guard--
not much
of a Buddhist


1807

simply trust,
simply trust!
cherry blossoms in bloom

the farm field too
is worth a look...

in yellow roses

someone else's green field


1807

the sky colors
of dawn have changed
to summer clothes


1807

every time I put on
the summer kimono...

yet he's under his fan
asleep

the rivers have
an ancient darkness...

cuckoo--
this year again, nothing
but weeds


1807

the cuckoo's becoming
a regular...
moonlit night


1807

making the nightingale
reach old age...
my thatched hut


1807

my fence where the nightingale
comes to sleep...
it too is old

is my wrinkled hand
bad for walking?

1807

while I'm gone
you and the nightingale are in charge
my snail


1807

fresh green leaves
blowing, blowing...
where I lie


1807

a chill runs up
my spine

a chill runs up
my spine...
Echigo mountains

my spine feels
the mottled mountain


1807

autumn evening--
this is nothing like
my home village


1807

departing clouds--
"Autumn won't return"
the cicadas sing


1807

a glimpse of moon
over my home village...
then clouds


1807

even the moon
over my home village...
brings tears


1807

bright moon--
in a little thicket too
a festival!


1807

mountain fog--
the beautiful voice
of the dung-hauler


1807

does it delight
the village child?
bell for the ancestors


1807

on the ancestors' altar
without fail
a lucky wind blows


1807

you saw the bonfires
for the dead?
mountain rain

in the red leaves...

chased away
by people

day by day
grows old

from the eaves
one by one...

blooming better
and better!

down and dirty
just as is...

have scattered

wipes his wet nose...

the year ends--
how long will that turtle
hang there?


1807

winter storm, winter wind--
the cow's sweat
blown away


1807

in winter wind

in his sleep

will soon need his prayer...

for the neighing horse
the cold night
same as for me


1808

a pine tree
like none other...
a cold night


1808

against the tree
by the gate a ladder...
a cold night


1808

one and all
faces of the Buddhas
cold tonight


1808

my paper lantern
is snatched away...
a cold night


1808

O snail
how do you make your living?
autumn dusk


1808

the owl is happy
in his solitude...
autumn dusk


1808

with the moon out
it seems to shrink back...
little mountain


1808

no sight yet
of the rising moon...
holy men


1808

Shinano road--
how many nights now
that moon on the eaves?


1808

not looking smoky
through hot spring steam...
face of the moon


1808

under my bottom
the stone warms up...
moonlit night


1808

lit by the harvest moon
no different...
trashy house


1808

autumn heavens--
for one little bird
so vast


1808

trusting its fate
to the autumn wind...
duckweed


1808

in autumn wind
this year's crop...
red leaves


1808

autumn wind--
death draws closer
with every year


1808

through what teeth
I have left
autumn's wind whistles


1808

what do you think
of the silver dew
Mr. Scarecrow?


1808

in the silver dew
I'd like to sow seeds
of plume grass


1808

happily watching
the dewdrops forming...
a frog


1808

stinging bug
you too someday, some time...
dewy grass


1808

the swallow's steady
stare...
lantern for the dead


1808

scarecrows at dusk
darkening...
human faces


1808

stored away
with reverence...
the scarecrow


1808

for people
and for scarecrows
the day ends


1808

despite your cries
young buck
rain falls on the mountain


1808

young buck--
his last cry
thin and long


1808

mountain deer
in bush clover dew...
wash your face!


1808

before the geese
can take their seats...
crows


1808

autumn's first geese
come first
to the poor town


1808

when a lantern comes
the insect breaks out
in song


1808

caged insect--
he's learned to sing
in all this smoke


1808

five or six trembling
rice plants...
my insect cage


1808

the insects' chorus
makes it smaller...
shrine


1808

Buddha and spoons
the whole wide world!
insects singing


1808

Musashi Plain--
in its middle at a inn
an insect cage


1808

singing all
the cool night long...
caged insect


1808

a butterfly emerges
and flies away...
morning moon


1808

hey toad
the caterpillar will grow
and fly away!


1808

he, too, quickly learns
how cold the morning is...
dragonfly


1808

when will it become
a cricket's nest?
my white hair


1808

"The world is good!
Good!" so say
the locusts


1808

not shrinking back
from the sunset...
wildflowers


1808

in grass where the wolf
shed his fur...
wildflowers


1808

wildflowers--
high over people's heads
the bell tolls


1808

out of the grasses
the inevitable
wildflowers!


1808

birds singing--
wild daisies too
are blooming


1808

in the musket's
line of fire...
a maiden flower


1808

decorating the puppy
bush clover
blooms


1808

children play
with the deer
bush clover blooming


1808

bush clover blooming--
the big dog
sound asleep


1808

every evening
not growing old...
blooming bush clover


1808

in one sleeve
the plume grass wind
buffets


1808

the autumn fly's
final sleeping spot...
paulownia leaf


1808

dropping plop!
onto the puppy...
one leaf


1808

after one day
among people...
one leaf left


1808

not a pretty sight
the paulownia leaf
wind-blown


1808

one by one
ignored by people...
mushrooms


1808

a "Praise Buddha!"
pops to my lips...
mushrooms


1808

pines shed their needles--
come mushroom-hunting time
who'll be here?


1808

among the reeds
on the year's last evening...
a wooden drum


1808

standing
in the dying year's sun...
nettle tree


1808

plum tree--
the dumping ground for
Kyoto's soot


1808

bamboo soot-broom--
the horse's head too
by and by


1808

bamboo soot-broom--
the first nightingale's
singing spot


1808

sweeping soot
the sun sets in peace...
vegetable field


1808

sweeping soot--
plum blossoms at the gate
indifferent


1808

in the tree's shade
pounding rice cakes
for Amida Buddha


1808

pounding rice cakes--
in Kyoto all chickens
are awake


1808

in a Sumiyoshi nook
growing a year older...
sea gulls


1808

despised
by the barrier guard...
a plover sings


1809

cornerstone--
on New Year's morning
a bird without a nest


1809

on New Year's Day
I have company
bird without a nest


1809

on New Year's Day
a balancing act in her sleep...
pretty woman


1809

less and less First Month
as nights pass by...
mist


1809

missing the boat
for First Month...
spring breeze


1809

morning's laugh--
"How much do they cost,
spring's blossoms?"


1809

now with homeless eyes
I see it...
blossoming spring


1809

for this homeless body
of mine, spring's
first day


1809

homecoming servant--
pretending the persimmon
is sweet


1809

homecoming servant--
the paulownia tree too
grew up fast


1809

in the mop's
drying place...
my New Year's pine


1809

making charcoal balls
one by one...
a long day


1809

in the long day
passing with mouth wide...
a crow


1809

at spring's last night
the owl
is nagging


1809

paying no attention
to the departing spring...
crows


1809

the little shrine
is all azaleas...
spring rain


1809

today too
looking at the same mountain...
spring rain


1809

spring rain--
mud-dumplings too
gifts from afar


1809

spring rain--
better than the flowers of others
my little thicket


1809

the spring breeze
blows all evening too...
Higashi Mountains


1809

spring breeze--
drying in the grass
a paper dog


1809

spring wind--
even in the pillar's hole
pollen


1809

spring breeze--
on a night journey to see
Higashi Mountains


1809

spring breeze--
even at night a market stand
on Naniwa Bay


1809

accusing the pine
of foolishness...
evening mist


1809

to my window
he comes as usual...
thin mist


1809

the evening bath
slish-slosh...
mist


1809

it's my umbrella-hat
don't run, geese!
first mist


1809

in heat shimmers
the vines people loathe...
beautiful


1809

heat shimmers--
yesterday it wasn't there
tea-and-dumpling shop


1809

snow melting--
for sparrows at the gate
good as a harvest moon!


1809

snow melting--
at the gate the sparrows'
New Year's bash!


1809

"I'm the first
of the migrating servants!"
a crow


1809

umbrella-hat and skirt
in the evening...
threshing tea leaves


1809

a plowman facing
sunset...
Mount Tsukuba


1809

at dawn
the homeless cat, too
cries for love


1809

the lover cat
dandied up like Genji
at the fence


1809

settling into
the penny toss hole...
baby sparrow


1809

chasing the crow
ten or twelve yards...
mother sparrow


1809

baby sparrow
inside a person's fist
its first cry


1809

fledgling faces
peek out the nest...
sparrows


1809

the nightingale
hushes to listen...
tea-picking song


1809

accompanying the rain
with its tail...
a pheasant


1809

seeing off
the departing geese...
little pines


1809

an auspicious
twenty fifth day...
the geese depart


1809

traveling geese
my lake is crossed
in no time


1809

a butterfly flits
as if wanting nothing
in this world


1809

butterflies flitting--
pretty little bamboo shoots
shooting up


1809

nothing else blooming
but rape...
my hut


1809

wisteria trellis--
behind it, in the light
wildflowers


1809

plum blossom scent--
I tell you spring
is a night thing


1809

the plum tree
where the stray cat carouses
in bloom


1809

my home village--
even in summer
plum trees bloom


1809

plum blossom scent--
the edict board furnished
with sacred sake


1809

simply trust!
cherry blossoms flitting
down


1809

cherry blossoms scatter--
bad Buddhists
carousing


1809

cherry blossoms!
country nightingales
country candy


1809

one cherry tree
has kept blooming...
the corrupt world


1809

secluded house--
the cherry blossoms late
the bonito...late


1809

a windy place!
but one cherry tree
in bloom


1809

fifty years
of gazing, gazing...
cherry blossoms


1809

in a Sumiyoshi nook
blooming
cherry blossoms


1809

simply trust!
cherry blossoms fall
pit-a-pat


1809

even the frog's eyes
can't turn away...
cherry blossoms!


1809

green with envy--
blooming cherry trees
little house


1809

the old cherry tree
blooming
till it drops


1809

mountain cherry blossoms--
in all 88
sacred sites


1809

my mean peach tree
nice and chubby
with blossoms


1809

peach tree in bloom--
but first a prayer
for the dewy barley


1809

green willows--
at ten different holes
gamblers tossing pennies


1809

rustling
in Goddess Kannon's heart...
the willow


1809

planting a willow--
someday, in summer
who'll enjoy its cool air?


1809

again there is splendor
beyond the gate...
willow tree


1809

coming now
is it a Kiso cloudburst?
Mount Asama


1809

under the cloudburst
standing tall...
lamps in the grove


1809

in the cloudburst
there's not a gate
without a pink


1809

extending from my pillow
in the downpour...
plume grass


1809

every evening
"Rain is coming!"
cloud watchers


1809

night festival--
a big cloudburst
strolls through


1809

in the pine breeze
the saint's pure water
flows


1809

raising it for
my summer seclusion's view...
little pine


1809

a praying mantis
at the base of Mount Fuji
clings


1809

it's Mount Fuji's grass
but no trace
of cool air


1809

no Mount Fuji
I can almost straddle
this year


1809

let's thatch with irises--
Mount Asama's smoke
looks calm


1809

swallows return
on the day eaves are thatched
with irises


1809

from the mountain
I see my own gate...
summer banner


1809

pit-a-pat pearls
of sweat drip down...
rice plants


1809

it's the nightingale's
dinnertime...
I change to a summer robe


1809

new summer robe--
from morning on used
by the pine


1809

Kasuga Field's deer
sniff it...
my summer kimono


1809

first day of summer
my summer kimono...
rustic


1809

watching the whiteness
of summer kimonos...
Sumida River


1809

a boor with the ladies
but he puts one on...
thin summer kimono


1809

tomorrow night and the next
the same?
in my mosquito net, alone


1809

stopping to count
my mosquito net's holes...
sickle moon


1809

high noon--
inside the mosquito net
wildflowers blooming


1809

stroke victim--
even holding a paper fan
an ordeal


1809

smoking out mosquitoes--
soon the fireflies
are gone too


1809

veiling the face
of the evening moon...
smudge pot smoke


1809

they're all slandering
my rice field!
evening cool


1809

stitching her eyes shut
makes the bird cry...
cool air at the gate

for the fawn...

growing up
with the bush clover...

in a province without rice fields
splendid


1809

it has a sky
for singing cuckoos...
farmhouse


1809

three raindrops
and three or four
fireflies


1809

a softly blowing
world-improving breeze...
fireflies flit


1809

into my pitiful kettle
one by one...
fireflies


1809

"Come, fireflies!"
a single stalk of bamboo
makes my night


1809

sparkling fireflies--
even the frog's mouth
gapes


1809

evening falls--
fireflies dampen
the thin tatami mat


1809

the pesky mosquito's
birthplace...
temple flower


1809

do you also miss
your mother?

1809

the world-healing
bamboo! little thicket!

1809

come what may
won't you trust in the Buddha
snail?

it's Buddha's rain
that's falling!
snail


1809

the peony has bloomed!
the whole day
sparrows chirping


1809

the cat's bell tinkling
in the peonies
here and there


1809

at my hut--
rascally crows
emaciated peonies


1809

staring at the shoots
of new bamboo...
Buddha


1809

"Grow, grow, grow
melons!"
buzz the bees


1809

thick drapes over
the deutzia blossoms...
willow


1809

deutzia blossoms--
by lantern light
I bury the frog


1809

blooming deutzia--
both of us
Buddha's devotees

and then another...
beads of dew


1809

without fanfare
they've borne plums!

stand ripening

about halfway
burned out...

awaiting the stars
throwing out tea grounds...

is led away from Kiso...
his tail waving goodbye


1809

the cricket's song
is accompaniment...
the rice field drains


1809

evening smoke--
on the man playing pigeon flute
it hangs


1809

for pine and bamboo
it's like olden days...
cloth-pounding


1809

like in Old China
Yoshino, too, clonks...
evening cloth-pounding


1809

this year's sake--
first toast:
to the weeds!


1809

in deep grass
a quail sings...
grandma starches clothes


1809

migrating birds--
how many of your flocks
have overtaken me?


1809

migrating birds
haven't you seen me before
in Japan?


1809

bagworm--
hanging in the plum tree
his job


1809

bagworm--
hanging from flowers
his job


1809

a cicada chirrs--
suddenly light breaks
toward the lake


1809

atop the magistrate's
folding fan...
a locust

grows old

on the raw slices
of first day, Eighth Month...

at my gate...

kitten watches...

red roses of Sharon
enough to cool
a man

little chestnuts
it's not yet your day
to burst


1809

a reedy place--
from the gate onward
gathering mushrooms


1809

the horsefly calls
"Surely the mushrooms
are this way!"


1809

"This way
to the mushrooms!"
the horsefly flies


1809

one by one--
even the mouse's hole
has mushrooms


1809

it suits me--
even the former owner's
winter cold

what are you praying for
katydid?


1809

will I be the next one
you caw over?

hut, home
to the New Year's god

so-and-so

to the Other Shore

"Hey bagworm
are you ready?" asks
the flitting butterfly

"Be brave, cherry blossoms
and fall!"

the bamboo grass shade
an empty hope...
little trout


1810

darting to the rhythm
of blossoms falling...
little trout

little trout
swimming west while blossoms
flow east

letting clams
vomit mud...
a moonlit night

an arm for a pillow--
though there's nagging
a firefly guest

so quickly they join
the human goblins...
fireflies

the owl
seems to be hooting
for fireflies

though a poor-soiled
province...

living apart
from the bamboo shoots...

bickering in the long night
in a nook
of Sumida River

to my rib cage ribs
O the night
is long!

along

fills Kyoto's sky

in the grassy meadow
flickering red...

on the beggarly vine...
buds


1812

following the times
even my hut's grasses
so young!


1812

new grass--
at the town's back door
Mount Fuji


1812

croaking frogs--
"Mustard in the ditch
has bloomed!"


1812

in the flowering mustard
Kazusa-style
"Praise Buddha!"


1812

in the flowering mustard
well, well
the great god Inari!


1812

beyond the gate
of flowering mustard...
Sumida River


1812

at the edge
of the flowering mustard...
Mount Fuji


1812

Praise Buddha!
my little side-field
has bloomed with rape


1812

flimsily
the beggar's mustard flowers too
have bloomed


1812

like they're calling
to the nightingale...
the bracken


1812

plum in bloom--
a beggar's blossoms too
next door


1812

on his scrap of mat
four or five pennies...
plum blossoms


1812

in the field
of the Buddha of Misfortune
plum blossoms!


1812

though they bloomed
they're not much to look at...
plum blossoms


1812

in hell's mirror
the plum-blossom thief's
reflection


1812

brother, look!
Sakubei's shop has
plums


1812

coins clattering
he thanks them politely...
plum blossoms


1812

at the end of the money-
begging rope...
plum blossoms


1812

in the woods where
a wild boar was spotted...
plum blossoms


1812

an uproar 'round
the penny toss hole...
blossom shade


1812

spreading as far
as Hokkaido...
Buddha's law and blossoms


1812

squirming
through the cherry blossoms...
people


1812

in scattering blossoms
Buddha and Buddhism
unknown


1812

scattering cherry blossoms--
thirsty for that faraway
mist


1812

year after year
the sin of blossoms...
wrinkled now


1812

bloom, cherry trees!
Buddha's law spreads
to Hokkaido


1812

in this world
over hell...
viewing spring blossoms


1812

stepchild cherry blossoms--
not stunted
at all


1812

where they dug up
the blooming cherry tree
the wind blows


1812

second day
at market, drying up...
cherry blossoms


1812

like they fell
from heaven...
cherry blossoms


1812

the month's
Mr. Ten and Mr. Nine...
cherry blossoms


1812

he's a mountain
cherry blossom-crazed
old man


1812

as soon as it bloomed
they dug up
the cherry tree


1812

yellow roses--
a horse tied
to an old Jizo


1812

dangling
in the yellow roses
the bull's balls


1812

Sixth Month--
the brutal heat
is no more


1812

over my head
a Sixth Month night
of moon


1812

summer's early dawn--
dwindling night reveals
a willow


1812

nighttime in Edo
is especially short...
it seems


1812

nights growing shorter
a delight...
sweet nostalgia


1812

all the short summer night
hard at work puffing...
Mount Asama


1812

short summer night--
little puff-ball flowers
have bloomed


1812

"The summer night
so brief, so brief!"
people and blossoms agree


1812

a hot day's treasure
they say, little clump
of trees


1812

the beards of millet
in good health...
such heat!


1812

herons in a row--
everywhere the same
cool breeze


1812

trailing behind
the cool air...
the month's last day


1812

summer cool--
the puffy clouds
like handballs


1812

when evening falls
the willows of Edo
chill


1812

old age--
even the cool moon
soon grows tiresome


1812

a crab pinches
the leaf of a reed--
Fifth Month rain


1812

Sakamoto--
thatched huts, thatched huts
and Fifth Month rain


1812

Fifth Month rain--
not a rock
without azaleas


1812

Mr. Toad--
the Fifth Month rains
have begun!


1812

the bagworm
has strong karma...
Fifth Month rain


1812

just three raindrops
and they call it
"A stormy night!"


1812

just three raindrops
"A cloudburst!
A cloudburst!"


1812

rainstorm--
at the edge of the sea
it starts


1812

in the cloudburst
a crane-tortoise-pine-bamboo
attitude


1812

touching the head
of the raining cloud...
plume grass


1812

the cloudburst's
target...
teahouse in a field


1812

the cloudburst's
answer to sunlight...
a night sky


1812

like he's snapping
at the downpour...
gargoyle


1812

standing in the cloudburst
keeping her cool...
maiden flower


1812

rainstorm--
a poor sake bottle
rolls along


1812

the cloud mountain
behind one blade of grass
vanishes


1812

the peaks of clouds
hiding
in the grass


1812

festival day--
even the little clouds
forming peaks


1812

don't run away
from the sickle moon
billowing clouds!


1812

Musashi Plain--
the flea also heads
for the peaks of clouds


1812

of Noin

the goddess of spring's
child, come out too!

crossing the river
taking a leak...

1812

the hairy bug
becomes a butterfly...

the door opens
to Naniwa Bay...
summer moon


1812

summer moon--
there's no such thing
as a flawless night


1812

guarded by the goddess
Kannon...
pure water


1812

pure water over moss--
come, pigeons!
come, sparrows!


1812

praise Buddha's
compassionate saints!
pure water


1812

my home village--
even behind the outhouse
pure water gushes


1812

come nightfall
it still gushes diligently...
pure water


1812

in the cogon grass
it rustles again...
rice dumpling wrapper


1812

rustle-rustle
nibbling on a rice dumpling...
a pretty woman

changing into
my summer robe

in a gourd...

like blue sky
the summer kimono
I'm wearing


1812

a kimono for a sail
rushing along...

like a felled tree
in his summer kimono...

in Kyoto even she enjoys
the cool breeze


1812

night after night--
even the beggarly vine
enjoys the cool air


1812

hey nightingale
what blooms at the icehouses
of Edo?

in my palm
next to one of my lice...

cuckoo


1812

at dawn
Edo's new arrival...

entering Edo
the first voice I hear
"cuckoo!"

worthy of Sir Cuckoo--

prayers drown you out...

mountain country--
why do you dislike it
cuckoo?


1812

the boat departs--
right next to his head
a cuckoo


1812

to our ears
just a lot of noise...
the cuckoo


1812

a mountain cuckoo sings
"Don't fall off
that horse!"


1812

looking down at the village
of white walls
mountain cuckoo


1812

just one reed
for the reed thrush...
Sumida river


1812

hey reed thrush--
it's four or five inches tall
Mount Tsukuba


1812

a reed thrush--
Mount Tsukuba
in a corner of the sky


1812

to the rhythm
of a moorhen's cries...
a cloud speeds by


1812

mocking Mokubo Temple's
prayer gong...
a moorhen calls


1812

a single blade
of grass beckons...
the firefly


1812

kept as pets
by citizens of Edo...
fireflies

he likes the grass
of my umbrella-hat...

of my eating...

"Don't bump your head
on that stone!"
flitting firefly


1812

fly away, firefly
my hut's smoky!
smoky!


1812

called forth
by Mr. Long-Beard...
the first firefly

a mouth calling fireflies--
one
flies in


1812

evening falls--
to the just-sold grass
fireflies flit


1812

one cocoon
in the stone Buddha's
lap


1812

beyond the swarming
mosquitoes, the no-good
nettle tree


1812

one mosquito
flies down my throat...
an uproar!


1812

my hut's fleas
how cute!
they sleep with me


1812

a flea jumps
in the laughing Buddha's
mouth


1812

evening--
in a big sake cup
moon and a flea


1812

cicadas chirring
the red leaf flutters
down


1812

"first cicada!"
he says
while it pisses


1812

cooling his butt
toward the lake...
cicada singing


1812

the dog turns
in the cicada's direction...

"Come! Come to the old man's
teahouse!"


1812

the duckweed too
may have prayed...
blooming in the west

snagged by the buck's
antler, one
fallen leaf

down

blanketed with snow...
my residence


1812

on my thin legs
smack! smack!

slapping the big
chrysanthemum's face...
falling leaf


1812

even newborn leaves
turned red...
fall like tears

on purple clouds
when will I set sail?
western sea


1812

what a shame!
how many canes prop you up
old pine?


1812

a five-inch nail--
the pine tree
is weeping


1812

not yet Buddha--
the mindless old
pine


1812

in pine-tree shade
sleeping, eating...
sixty provinces!


1812

even for bamboo
there's nothing but
crookedness

a thousand years
until the next life?

no customary
New Year's Day
for the slob


1813

blossoms--
from this morning on
29 springs to go


1813

joining
the brushwood fire's smoke
morning's blossoms


1813

with gums for grinders
greeting the blossoming
spring


1813

just when my house
has gotten used to deep snow...
spring blossoms

a servant on holiday
behind me says a prayer...
Mount Matchi


1813

lucky beans
and lucky tea
just for me alone


1813

spring at my gate--
the first New Year's greeting
from sparrows


1813

a Kyoto suburb--
even flying kites
is hard


1813

even the beggar
hopes to get rich...
god of wealth singers


1813

a beggar's New Year's song
too
in the mist


1813

one leaf
for the nightingale...
New Year's herbs


1813

dirty nails
facing my New Year's dish
ashamed


1813

blatantly the snow
falls pit-a-pat...
spring peace


1813

the lame chicken
dragging, dragging...
a long day


1813

to the beat
of a pheasant's cries
spring dusk


1813

hey spear holder!
don't let the spring
escape!


1813

small talk
down in the cellar...
spring rain


1813

first thing after waking up
spring rain
in my eyes


1813

letting her parent carry
the paper lantern...
spring rain

night of haze
with a bellyful of rice cakes...
Higashi Mountains


1813

even in spring mist
it's snow-covered...
my home


1813

misty day--
with their eyes sewn shut
geese honking


1813

all is misty
even my eyes!
from this new year on


1813

with the pounding
of a pestle
the mist gathers


1813

don't cry, children!
the red mist
has passed away


1813

western mountains
when I'm carried away
which mist will I ride?


1813

the moon
in Buddha's bucket, too...
mist-covered


1813

you, too, turn to
heat shimmers...
my thatched house


1813

heat shimmers--
from inside the rice cake tub
one more


1813

heat shimmers--
chasing the village crow
with a hoe


1813

heat shimmers--
the child's lost chicken
struts in the distance


1813

my hut's snow
not very good
at dying


1813

geese and ducks
honking, quacking it away...
melting snow


1813

Shinano road--
when the snow finally melts
mosquitoes whine


1813

come, sparrows
in all four corners the gate's
snow is melting!


1813

the momentous snow
has melted away...
late riser


1813

servants take a break
from their migration...
kite flying


1813

migrating servants--
wherever you go, the same
plum blossoms!


1813

the widow, too
leaves a doll
among the cherry trees


1813

picking herbs--
on my coat a croaking
frog


1813

on the old umbrella-hat
smack! smack!
threshing tea leaves


1813

a mountain crow
helps the fire setters...
little thicket


1813

grass fire on its way
to the hot tub
in the field


1813

the children
make it a playground...
burnt field


1813

as if the villagers
are frozen...
burning field


1813

fire on field and mountain--
at night this world
ain't bad!

where I planted seeds
oh well!

the chicken
is standing guard...
my grafted tree

deep in the sake goblet
yowling!

shake a leg!
the wife calls


1813

smeared with flowering
rape, here comes
the lover cat


1813

O flowering mustard
blow the cat's prowling route
shut!


1813

Kasuga Field--
even the rascally buck
sheds his antlers


1813

may I offer you
a head scarf?
buck after antler-shedding


1813

the buck looks
at cherry blossoms...
shedding his antlers


1813

at my house
there's nothing!
the bird's left the nest


1813

on the tip of the
newly sprouted bamboo...
a baby sparrow


1813

taking turns
guarding the nest...
parent sparrows


1813

the baby sparrow
is allowed to play...
tatami mat


1813

baby sparrows, too
arrive for the Buddha's
morning showing

in the great bronze
Buddha's nose chirping...

1813

staying behind--
the nightingale's only
daughter

nightingale
this fence is reserved
for you

catching the spirit
of the nightingale's song...

he seems to have
the nightingale's back...

the nightingale
not at all concerned...
little gambling shack


1813

while imitating
a nightingale...
a nightingale!

why the rush
to go so soon?

nightingale, don't suffocate
from the pipe smoke!
Edo mountain


1813

samurai--
even the nightingale
gives orders


1813

sing! sing!
though off key
my nightingale


1813

trying to sleep--
that nightingale on the eaves
is a nightingale!


1813

he's a prince
of a nightingale!
you could say


1813

arriving with faces that say
it's been a long time...
swallows


1813

seeing Oi River
and then...
a lark


1813

a fishing boat rows
over blossoms...
a skylark


1813

coming down
to eat his lunch...
skylark


1813

a pheasant cries--
soup steam wafts over
wild grasses


1813

"The shrine in the field
is too red!"
the pheasant cries


1813

around noon a pheasant
passes through...
the big sitting room


1813

"The crow took
the fried rice!"
the pheasant cries


1813

the evening pheasant's
sleeping place...
a little shrine


1813

the evening pheasant
runs then stops...
grass and sky


1813

clamorous
wild geese who saw Edo
returning home


1813

Zenko Temple, too
quickly passed over...
geese flying north


1813

once again
the deer see them off..
geese flying north


1813

don't go geese!
everywhere it's a floating world
of sorrow


1813

trampling Asakusa's
little Fuji...
a croaking frog


1813

"Hey puppy
come here!" croaks
the frog


1813

in leaves of grass
playing hide-and-seek...
a frog


1813

chin-deep
in the fallen blossoms...
a frog


1813

in his retreat
in the flowering mustard
a croaking frog


1813

enjoying your sex
so shamelessly?
frogs

onto a straw lid
marked "Smallpox"
hops a frog

never opening
their mouths in vain...
frogs

at Mokubo Temple
bunking on a flower...
a frog

even around here
the world is good!
frogs croaking


1813

my back-alley home--
five feet of sky
but spring butterflies


1813

morning rain--
a butterfly licks
it up


1813

Suruga Road--
even the butterflies dream
about Mount Fuji


1813

weak tea--
every day the butterfly
stops by


1813

tea smoke--
into the butterfly's face
it blows

a butterfly comes
to my good-for-nothing
hut


1813

amid butterflies
little butterflies
mountain home


1813

a butterfly, a cat
deep asleep...

lending it
to the sleeping butterfly...

stuck to the dog
curled asleep...
a butterfly

with great importance...
violets


1813

hopping over the river
of blooming violets...
pretty woman


1813

like playing cards
these blossoms of rape
at the gate


1813

even the bracken
are like nails...
Kyoto


1813

in grassy shade
looking like canes...
the bracken


1813

for Toribe Field's
holy Jizo...
bracken


1813

even wild rose buds--
all eaten
by people


1813

Kamakura--
who planted these camellias
in olden times?


1813

plum blossom scent--
a house with four walls
can't be found


1813

plum blossom scent--
the voices of children
sound reverent

plum blossoms--
the candy nightingale
opens his mouth


1813

plum blossoms--
riding a dog
the Peach Boy


1813

secluded house--
enough plum blossoms
for brewing tea


1813

nothing special
to the village dog...
plum blossoms


1813

snatched
by the stray cat...
plum blossoms


1813

plum blossoms
of the field dropped...

someone chanting
the Lotus Sutra...
plum blossoms

1813

in scattering blossoms
holding their breath...

fallen blossoms--
the stylish woman leaves
her butt print

riding in a palanquin
the blossom thief!
blossom thief!


1813

blossoming mountain--
come out and play
devil in me!


1813

the old fence too
has Third Month, 10th day
blossoms!


1813

donning my umbrella-hat--
cherry blossoms portend
a lucky day


1813

sticking, sticking
to paper umbrellas...
cherry blossoms


1813

lining the bottom
of the trash can...
cherry blossoms


1813

the cherry blossoms fall--
I apologize to a dog
in passing


1813

cherry blossoms
I waited and waited for...
I'm alone


1813

while viewing mountain
cherry blossoms...
a prayer


1813

evening cherry blossoms
to the prayer gong's beat
scatter


1813

from willow tree
from plum tree comes
the fox!


1813

from the willow
a ghost attacks!
the child


1813

summer night--
like a lump of fried rice
Mount Fuji


1813

dewdrops spilling--
suddenly the nights
grow short


1813

in the middle of the short
summer night blooming...
azaleas


1813

short summer night--
sister's silkworms
in a feeding frenzy


1813

short summer night--
the silkworms' mouths
chomping


1813

short summer night--
the hairdresser's wildflowers
blooming


1813

short summer night--
an umbrella-shaped flower
has bloomed


1813

in the short summer night
wriggling to climax...
maiden flowers


1813

short summer night--
the frogs croaking
trash talk


1813

the flower that looks
like a wind-chime blooms...
the heat


1813

oh cool cool
evening!
the month's last day


1813

it's a down, down
downtrodden land...
but cool!

the cool, windy moon
is shut out too...

1813

what cool air--
snow and ice
two cents apiece


1813

in the cool air
me and flame-drawn
katydid


1813

cool air--
the evening mountain
becomes itself


1813

cool air--
like pillows beyond the gate
the mountains


1813

cool air--
again from the west
an evening shower


1813

cool air--
a moonlit night fit
for a god


1813

lying spread-eagle
cool
lonely


1813

nothing at all
but a calm heart
and cool air


1813

two blades of grass
cheer for the cloudburst
I bring


1813

blessings fall
on Mount Togakushi...
a cloudburst


1813

little straw mat--
the cloudburst just a spurt
but a good one


1813

perfectly round
the cloud's first
burst


1813

taking the cloudburst's
place
just teardrops


1813

a bowl to catch
the cloudburst...
my hut


1813

a summer rainstorm--
scratches
my itch

1813

a good omen--
in the west, deep red
billowing clouds


1813

on the tips
of my outstretched toes...
billowing clouds


1813

noontime--
about pillow high
the billowing clouds


1813

the swimming flea
thinks to reach them...
peaks of clouds

vain clouds
forming vain peaks
in vain


1813

watching the clouds
drifting to sleep...

in pure water

new red flowers
have bloomed...
pure water over moss

at my home
Shinano's moon
and pure water!


1813

at the gate
a palm-sized rice field too
has greened


1813

my portion of rice field
turns green too...
evening's wooden drum


1813

my side-field of rice--
the first to turn
green! green!


1813

even under the eaves
human handiwork...
a green rice field

festival--
for whose treasured child
this red fan?

left behind

from horses...

growing old--
one drop of sweat
soon, another


1813

this day perhaps
even I'll do it...

1813

in our new summer robes
the gate's nettle tree
and me


1813

the first and best
of Shitaya Ward...
in summer kimono


1813

with a face like he's licked
persimmon paper...
a new summer robe


1813

hating the "four"
of Fourth Month...
the change to summer clothes

into the sleeves...
summer robe

western mountains--
I'm off to play paper fan gliders
under the moon


1813

shading
Mr. Long-Beard's eyes...
a paper fan from Kyoto


1813

like a belt encircling
the mountain's hips...
smudge pot smoke


1813

the smudge pot smoke
is a comfort...
my life alone


1813

my home village--
the smudge pots trailing
mist


1813

even water sprinkled
at the gate costs money...

cooling off...
not quite flawless

and a stalk of bamboo...

with sweet jelly

from a tub
of sweet jelly it flows...

along with the plume grass
sways

the moon like a tub
has risen...

of Edo's rain did you drink?

I hope your busy-ness
isn't contagious

is sweet!

to run

of the Lotus Sutra...
a firefly flies

my dwelling--
mingling with the mice
pretty fireflies

1813

mosquito swarm--
into my sleeve
they rise


1813

comparing butts
in Kannon's temple...
mosquitoes


1813

where there's people
there's mosquitoes...
admiring the willow

my hut's flies
come along too...
returning home

catches fleas
from people

tired of walking
on my wrinkled arm
the flea jumps

and see
Matsushima

on the young
are pretty

held in contempt
by fleas and flies...

makes a healthy ruckus...

in my young bamboo!
young bamboo!

it's called "young bamboo"
for one night only...
or two

eyes, melons
cooling in water

for deep, cool shade...

a long day--
Holy Binzuru and blossoms
of Sleeping Tree

deutzia blossoms--
on the road to Fushimi
a dog


1813

nippy weather--

sinks in

does the monkey understand
"morning cold"?
a little nod


1813

I rub, rub my ribs
still the night
is cold


1813

oh Goddess of Mercy
from this cold night
deliver me!

from the pigeon coop

stirs, night's cold
begins

on Ryogoku Bridge
in both directions...

has passed me over...
autumn dusk

at my hut too
the night turns long...
bottoms up!


1813

night at my hut--
this sinful oversleeping
weighs heavily!


1813

feeling afraid--
nights of so much sleep
are sinful!


1813

wooden clogs
clomp! clomp!
a long, weary night


1813

for you lice
is the night long?
is it lonely?


1813

long!
the night is long!
"Praise Amida..."


1813

a long night--
the devil in me
torments me

"Praise Buddha!
Praise Buddha!"

the night must be long...
and lonely?

the fleas this long night
in a fine mood

on my belly...
a long night

looking pretty
in a hole in the paper door...

runs up my spine...
dew dripping down

in passing

among the dewdrops
the butterfly's mood
improves

1813

sucking up
all the dewdrops...

coating

"First snowfall!"
and then, soon enough
three or four feet

first snowfall
on irises in the eaves
softly, softly

over his shoulder...

turning my back
to Mount Hakone

and its halo...

at evening
like washed-out ink...

a drab color
but it's the year's
first sky!

will heal my weak foot...
again

up in smoke

crow

in a thorn patch
some paper, to and fro...
a long day


1814

holding a spear
riding a horse...
a long day


1814

hey lice--
crawl after the departing
spring!


1814

a light snow
over fields, through woods...
pilgrims


1814

remembering
to fall again...
a light spring snow


1814

in a village
deep in the willows...
spring snow


1814

potted plum tree
sparrows in bamboo...
spring rain


1814

like a proper guest
the dog falls in...
spring rain


1814

cheer up, owl!
the spring rain
is falling


1814

behind the thicket
an offering box...
spring rain


1814

for every thicket
every thicket...
spring rain


1814

the horse's paper decorations
feel it first...
spring breeze


1814

with the spring breeze
spring reaches Edo...
the willows!


1814

in the spring breeze
my second pipe's
smoke


1814

spring breeze--
the great courtier
poops in the field


1814

spring breeze--
a little thicket, little festival
little pilgrim


1814

spring breeze--
on holy Jizo's lips
a grain of rice


1814

spring breeze--
packed with people
the mountain temple


1814

rice cake with bean paste
on holy Jizo's lap
the spring breeze


1814

silver water flowing
toward the garden...

1814

on an earthen bridge
an offering of sake...
spring moon


1814

steam from my bath
and the moonlight...
springtime!


1814

from the roof's overhang
dripping, dripping...
hazy moon


1814

over the pole I stuck
in the garden...
hazy moon


1814

in the mist
crows are rejoicing...
nothing else


1814

misty evening--
out the back door too
Yoshiwara


1814

a custom-made mist
just for it...
nettle tree


1814

gambling in the field
a sermon in the thicket...
one mist


1814

one soars
released from the mist...
nettle tree


1814

snatching a jellied rice cake
in the mist...
crow


1814

even in the mist
my village
is a mess


1814

from the face
of the man yelling for me...
mist


1814

in heat shimmers
the cat snores
deeply


1814

heat shimmers--
off the verandah tumbles
the half-asleep cat


1814

the snow melting
now flows away...
Chikuma River


1814

without fanfare
the great snow has left...
mountain


1814

about ten cooking pots
upside-down...
snow is melting!


1814

the round patches
the square patches...
snow floats away!


1814

in the remote village
snow melting also
is not easy


1814

snow melting
the village brimming over...
with children!


1814

in my province
nothing blooming yet...
spring equinox


1814

across the wide plain
a migrating servant
in a palanquin


1814

every house on the street
celebrates the festival...
clay dolls


1814

today
even in the mountain hut
rice cake for a doll


1814

thatched house--
on the doll's face dripping
rain


1814

a shelf of dolls
and pipe smoke...
one scene


1814

remote village--
they pound rice cakes
for their dolls


1814

oh sake cup
don't go floating away!
a sickle moon


1814

the chicken tries
walking on it first...
lid on the sunken hearth


1814

even while yawning
she keeps the tune...
tea picking


1814

Shigaraki--
even the high priest sings
a tea-picking song


1814

in the thicket
behind the house, silence...
no one picking tea


1814

make love, crows
while you can!
burning fields


1814

children and frogs
raise a cheer...
the field on fire


1814

following a cloud
he plows...
the mountain's hip


1814

mocking the farmer
plowing, the strutting
crow


1814

he plows his field
an arm's length away...
sea of grebes


1814

plowing the field--
a shower of mountain
cherry blossoms


1814

such yowling
don't turn to stone!
lover cat


1814

the love-crazed cat
strangely on edge
wanders off


1814

plum trees are eyesores!
cherry trees have thorns!
cats in heat


1814

with a voice
like a temple bell...
the lover cat


1814

the lover cats
bluntly go
their separate ways


1814

the lone orphan sparrow
nice
and plump


1814

come! come here!
digest your food

Come to the plum tree!"

coming to play
with me...

a red berry
in its beak posing...

in the nightingale's
song, steam
from the Buddha's rice


1814

only an off-the-cuff
song


1814

the nightingale's
"I'm perfect" face...
Kyoto's mountain


1814

the nightingale
flitting about makes his living
in the country


1814

nightingale--
just a run-of-the-mill
face


1814

nightingale--
just a run-of-the-mill
voice

should be blooming

a nightingale--
touring the countryside
should be fun


1814

the nightingale
doesn't bow...
plum trees in bloom

country accents, too
in the morning sky

his muddy feet...

swallows--
these peach blossoms belong
to you


1814

flying swallows--
as if there's no turning back
for them


1814

not much of a flyer

their cute butts suddenly
all in a row...
swallows


1814

before dinner
off to Kyoto and back...
swallows

at my hut, first thing--

of a swallow

1814

over Musashi Plain
only one...

from the gate sentinel's
flowerpot...
a skylark!

a late riser
he's slow to leave my window...
pheasant


1814

splish splash
across the shallow river...

1814

laying out my big mat
I make a pheasant
cry


1814

from the bucket
on the big roof...

on tiptoe
the pheasant cries


1814

as if it just spotted
a star
the pheasant cries


1814

in Holy Binzuru's lap
sound asleep...
a pheasant

sticking their necks
into the temple hall
pheasants sing

are you calling the wife?
scolding her?


1814

is that your wife-calling
voice?

all in a huff
seeing my face...

piddling on the mat
as he flees...

in the farm field
his wife hides...

crestfallen
by the scattering blossoms...

at the big sake cup...

and the gnawing, gnawing
silkworms

they're off to play
in Yoshino...

I'm the type
who'd rather have dumplings
than blossoms


1814

my dear one's hut--
lost amid blooming
blossoms


1814

no favorite
blossoming tree's shade
for me

in scattering blossoms
holding out his bowl...

he yawns in the hot
healing bath


1815

the cool breeze
meandering
arrives


1815

the cool breeze
through my neighbor's pine
just a remnant


1815

cool breeze--
on the cloud's outskirts
a little village


1815

the so-called
"cool evenings" of summer...
soon to be over


1815

cool air--
even in my soup
Mount Fuji!


1815

cool air--
for the great lord's
gatekeeper


1815

cool air--
bath steam and rice field
stirring


1815

this cool air comes
from Amida Buddha's
direction!


1815

evening cool--
visiting Ueno Hill
wears me out


1815

swift-footed it flees--
cloudburst!
cloudburst!


1815

soup bucket--
the summer cloudburst
has passed


1815

watching the downpour
under a temple
bell


1815

the cloudburst
scrubs it clean...
the old house


1815

the cloudburst
and Lord Kaga
splishing, splashing!


1815

even the cloudburst
shows the facing mountain
favoritism


1815

rainstorm--
two drops for the rice cake tub
three drops for the winnow


1815

my lovemaking--
Mount Tsukuba's clouds
bursting!


1815

green hedge--
a frog cheers
the billowing clouds


1815

today again
they're putting on a show...
billowing clouds


1815

billowing clouds--
toward the big drums
bring your rain


1815

like little dots
little billows in a row...
little clouds


1815

toward my line of sight
standing in a row...
cloud billows


1815

wind on the greenery--
a row of shrubs
for sale


1815

arms and legs spread wide
straddling
pure water


1815

from the shade
of the poison plant...
pure water


1815

my home village--
from my walking stick's hole
pure water gushes


1815

your rice field
my rice field
the same green


1815

the baby sparrow
splish-splash bathes...
in Buddha's tea


1815

on a little shrine
rustling with the azaleas...
rice dumplings


1815

medicine
for the nightingale's voice?
this morning's rain


1815

in my new summer robe
tucked in the sleeve...
tofu


1815

even the servant
poses like a saint...
new summer robe


1815

growing weary
of the diet...
my new summer robe


1815

growing old--
even a dog won't sniff
my summer kimono


1815

summer kimono--
a present for my bride
in Shinano


1815

summer kimono--
the rain kindly
washes it


1815

tomorrow's wind
blows tomorrow...
in my mosquito net, alone


1815

Osaka--
on the back of an ox
a siesta


1815

in the darkness
swishing, swishing...
paper fan


1815

softly snoring--
the cat curled up
on the fan


1815

after getting it
it's dropped so soon...
paper fan


1815

at my hut
with tobacco, smoking out
the mosquitoes


1815

airing out the bedding
and
the cat


1815

the fish in the tub
won't know tomorrow...
evening cool


1815

the fish
unaware of the bucket...
a cool evening


1815

saying my apology
to the sacred tree...
a cool breeze


1815

on the ground
we stick and sit...
evening cool


1815

a wifeless man
makes his plants bloom...
evening cool


1815

a farting contest
under the moonflower trellis...
cool air


1815

with a kitchen knife
choosing eels...
a cool evening


1815

massaging my back
with the pine tree's gnarl...
evening cool


1815

evening cool--
with my feet counting
Echigo mountains


1815

scowling
at the cool night...
gargoyle


1815

my rice field too
song by song
is planted


1815

rice-planting song--
let everyone's anger
be cured!


1815

in the thicket shade
all alone...
rice-planting song


1815

for eight pennies
the whole family celebrates...
summer ice!


1815

early rising
is medicine, they say!
cuckoo


1815

also behind me
returning from Nikko Shrine...
a cuckoo


1815

entering Edo
without fear or qualm...
cuckoo!


1815

scolded by old Sokan
never again...
cuckoo


1815

taking credit
for glorious Nikko...
cuckoo


1815

how was the festival
up at Nikko...
cuckoo?


1815

from the tip
of Hitomaro's brush...
a cuckoo


1815

"That's a poor excuse
for rain!"
sings the cuckoo


1815

a butterbur leaf
on his head, listen:
"cuckoo!"


1815

the cuckoo hurls threats
at the horse
passing by


1815

night work
on countless islands...
cuckoos


1815

lighting my pipe
with a candle...
"cuckoo!"


1815

Kakizaki--
with a stammering song
the mountain cuckoo


1815

the mountain cuckoo sings
at Mr. Toad's
funeral


1815

down in the shadows
lurks the ants' hell...
mountain cuckoo


1815

the house's former tenant
kindly left...
the mountain cuckoo!


1815

help yourself to the lice
in my thatched hut!
mountain cuckoo


1815

are you standing guard
like O-Take Buddha?
mountain cuckoo


1815

deigning to guard
my house...
the mountain cuckoo


1815

swarming 'round
the boat-hauler's legs...
fireflies


1815

sprinkled on
the raftsman's rice...
fireflies


1815

my child strikes
a sulky pose
calling fireflies


1815

sweeping them off
the cow's back...
fireflies


1815

the puppy comes out
and calls them too...
fireflies


1815

my firefly guest
do you disdain
my hut?


1815

get ready to see
my piss waterfall...
come, firefly!


1815

tripping
on the wrinkles of my hand...
firefly


1815

out! fireflies
I'm locking up...
out! fireflies


1815

the first firefly
to Buddha's lap
has fled


1815

visiting my chest
on its way...
firefly


1815

in an old bucket
rice plants rustle
fireflies flit


1815

firefly's light--
flitting through my hut
forms a cross


1815

guiding the way
to firefly-viewing...
the hut's dog


1815

hey firefly
sneak a peek behind her!
Goddess Kannon


1815

my home
a bit too cramped...
departing firefly


1815

my home--
surveying its flaws
a firefly


1815

mosquito larvae too
keep the sutra's
rhythm


1815

swatting a fly
on Buddha's holy
head


1815

while I'm away
enjoy your lovemaking
hut's flies


1815

after plastering 
the gate with fleas
the dog runs off


1815

the kitten rubs
her fleas
on the nettle tree


1815

from the pale red flower
a cicada
is born!


1815

mute cicada--
he, too, perfectly
at peace


1815

little monk--
deep in his sleeve
singing, a cicada


1815

drenched
by a rain shower
the cicada's voice


1815

Sumiyoshi--
growing up together
the cicadas sing


1815

cool breeze--
growing up together
the cicadas sing


1815

cicadas singing
it's a contagious
disease


1815

a cicada chirrs--
in the soon-to-be cut
pine tree


1815

cicadas chirr--
cocoons are drying up
drying up


1815

a cicada chirrs--
then flies in a flash
up my sleeve


1815

first cicada
are you singing for him?
Buddha's temple


1815

cicada in the pine
listening to the sutra
is born


1815

a face
like everyone else's...
the snail


1815

the brushwood door's
substitute lock...
a snail


1815

does the cloudburst
make you happy?
snail


1815

while praising the cool breeze
leeches
dropped


1815

speaking
this day's deepest thoughts...
poppies


1815

this world
bristles with thorns...
yet there are lotuses


1815

leftover rice plants--
even the horse
won't gobble them


1815

leftover rice plants--
even the horse
won't trample them


1815

over me
soon enough you'll bloom
moss blossoms


1815

in this world's wind
they thin out quick...
bamboo shoots


1815

one by one
the tall bamboo shoots
bending


1815

bamboo shoots--
big brothers, little brothers
swish, swish!


1815

blind luck--
bamboo shoots sprout
where they sprout


1815

my hut--
a creek serves
as my melon cooler


1815

the temple guard
sells tea cakes...
grove of summer trees


1815

even on the grafted willow
so quick!
thick summer grasses


1815

no lazing at the gate
they husk barley...
deep tree shade


1815

sells tea cakes...

1815

first, a deutzia blossom
for his hair...
temple actor


1815

in deutzia blossoms
a hatchling peeks out...
mountain


1815

feeling for the stone bridge
with my feet...
a cold night


1815

from Mr. Wolf
to Mr. Watchman...
night's cold


1815

I'm forced to play
the flute...
a cold night


1815

by the next room's lamplight
eating my rice...
a cold night


1815

old habit--
the cold nights of Kiso
on my knees


1815

my knees
this cold night in the mountains
feel older


1815

a flute plays--
suddenly night's coldness
begins


1815

feeling for parched beans
with my feet...
a cold night


1815

those who call me "starling"
raise a ruckus...
a cold night


1815

vain mankind
feeling like carousing...
a cold night


1815

walking off
a bellyful of rice cakes...
a cold night


1815

my hut--
moving from back to front
night's coldness


1815

the little monkey
chews on a pipe...
autumn dusk


1815

sleeping mat--
blowing pipe smoke
at the Milky Way


1815

consider this rubbish heap
a mountain...
autumn moon


1815

scolding
vain man...
the autumn moon


1815

hole in the wall--
my harvest moon
comes in


1815

harvest moon
and looking west
Zenko Temple!


1815

harvest moon--
even islands without pines
add to the head-count


1815

broken wall--
my harvest moon's
grand entrance


1815

though the autumn wind blows--
still
lazy


1815

autumn wind--
also behind me
Mount Usori


1815

vain mankind!
even in blossoming Kyoto
autumn wind


1815

setting the silkworm
moth adrift...
autumn wind


1815

sloppy, yes
but the dewdrops are pearls!
pearls!


1815

"Dewdrops here!"
the coaxing voice
of a mountain crow


1815

to which side
of the silver dew?
the crow's summons


1815

become pearls
great big pearls!
morning dew


1815

lightning flash--
the astonished face
of the dog


1815

lightning flash--
running like hell
to Zenko Temple


1815

my dog
turns a somersault...
field of flowers


1815

realizing it's being hit
just for fun...

lit by a bonfire
for the dead...

1815

from plume grass
has it arisen?

sings


1815

looking trendy
with four corners...

1815

throughout Shinano
on every Mount Suwa...

1815

just the sight
of plume grass chopsticks...

paying no heed
to Suwa Shrine's wind...
plume grass


1815

of plume grass too...

the first plume grass
has called it forth...

at my hut too
a stone for pounding
cloth

wild goose without companions
come! come!
to shelter


1815

my rice field too
is five or six feet!

begging at my gate
the geese lose
weight


1815

the black, the green,
the brown...
insect chorus


1815

insects sing, fly
here and there...
"just for us"


1815

a cicada chirrs--

doesn't care about looks
or style

in the morning-glories
peeking out...
a mouse

from behind Senso Temple
I pray

sleeping in a ball
on a winter's night...
my little nook

crosses then goes back...

he shoulders a musket
and a short sword

and hail

of pissing

with her samisen
she makes snow fall...

blossoming Kyoto
is it?

let loose
by some god above...

gets a dash...
sacred sake

a woman's voice
recites a prayer

first frost--
flower sellers in a row
hitting their bells

first frost--
the smiling face
of the tea master

a big rosary
'round his neck...
withered fields


1815

withered fields--
with rice bag on her head
she runs

red leaves fall
into the bonfires

time to unseal
the new tea!

praise Basho!
I've found my padded
cotton vest

"A dirty priest
in a red skullcap"...
he's called


1815

the farting contest
begins at once...
winter quilt


1815

guard over haiku
I beseech you!
snow Buddha


1815

first snow--
even a lump of it
is Buddha

snow Buddha--
my handprint too
is something to cherish

sparrows gather
and cheer...
my snow Buddha


1815

first snowfall--
it too
becomes Buddha

funny
the dog turns 'round...
snowball!

above the hibachis
of the Old Quarter
day breaks


1815

another early morning
laugh!
my charcoal fire


1815

even the bag
the charcoal came in
burned tonight!


1815

darkened by smoke
from the charcoal kiln...
paper door


1815

even the charcoal kiln
invariably
has neighbors


1815

straight up--
the smoke of Holy Gohei's
charcoal kiln


1815

snap and crackle
goes the fire...
"All praise to Amida Buddha!"


1815

in tea blossoms
the nightingale's child's
singing lessons


1815

though it's smoky
don't leave my hut!
singing plover


1815

trampling my roof thatch
to pieces...
plovers!


1815

plovers on a winter night--
not an old voice
among them


1815

hoarse-voiced plover
get in tune
with the others!


1815

slowly, slowly
plover with burnt tail feathers
where to now?


1815

though out of tune
they're Suma Beach's plovers!
plovers!


1815

even in Yoshiwara
in a one-ply wall
plovers in the night


1815

he looks like someone
I know! pufferfish's
bloated face


1815

the blooming cockscomb
dies
standing up


1815

no shame for you
red chrysanthemum!
another winter rain


1815

for the money-making
chrysanthemum, too...
the same withering


1815

among the withered
chrysanthemums...
brazen sparrows


1815

fallen leaves--
a chrysanthemum blooms
wretchedly


1815

grassy thicket--
what karma lets
the chrysanthemum survive?


1815

the plume grass
that hides the lovers...
withers


1815

windblown leaves
good job, cat!
pushing them


1815

the wind has brought
enough to build a fire...
fallen leaves


1815

the kitten catches one
for a second...
fallen leaves


1816

even for me
there's a guardian god!
blossoming spring


1816

this body of dust
softly, softly...
blossoming spring


1816

at my house
born with ease...
spring blossoms


1816

New Year's decorations--
the night I burn them
I cheer


1816

snow falls
on the celebration...
New Year's bonfire


1816

they make a pitiful fire...
my New Year's
decorations


1816

for the celebration
of little pines
the day stretches longer


1816

tied to the monkey's
back...
string of the kite


1816

even the kite
of the provincial lord
is bad-mouthed


1816

a kite rises
slow and easy...
a little village


1816

hugging his kite
he sleeps
deep and calm


1816

in one sky--
grand imperial kites
and little kites


1816

a wastepaper kite
next to that of Maeda
Lord Kaga!


1816

before the gate
the kite-snagging nettle tree...
a thousand ages old!


1816

dancing monkey--
its face also
isn't weary


1816

in my province
even trained monkeys
wear noble hats


1816

in my province
even trained monkeys
offer prayers!


1816

melting to the tune
of the New Year's singer...
snow at the gate


1816

the way things are--
in my do-nothing house
the day is long


1816

growing old--
even the long day
brings tears


1816

in the long day
scribbling on a wall...
eyes, nose


1816

in the long day
at my cane's tip...
a fuse cord


1816

the day is long!
long! in this vain
world today


1816

in this vain life
a sheer waste...
the long day


1816

from the tip
of the forest ranger's broom...
spring departs


1816

over the just-spread
sawdust...
spring snow


1816

spring snow--
on fresh-laid reeds
it falls


1816

spring snow--
not a single face
without a fan


1816

the first blessing
for plow and hoe...
spring rain


1816

splish-splash
the cat washes in the river...
spring rain


1816

spring rain--
he catches my yawn
dog at the gate


1816

spring breeze--
her sleeves rustle over
Mount Matchi


1816

spring wind--
the writing brush rolls away
in the field


1816

the thief
is just as he is...
hazy moon


1816

the temple teatime's
second call of the clapper...
morning mist


1816

vanishing
in the heat shimmers...
my humble hut


1816

heat shimmers--
shaped like a cross
the leftover snow


1816

young folk--
even melting snow
is fun, no?


1816

rice seedlings--
a little family watches
the evening rain


1816

rice-seedling beds
with no unevenness...
can't be found


1816

herb cakes--
cherry blossoms sprinkled
on top


1816

my intrepid guide
on the low tide beach...
village dog


1816

the katydid
on my hut's post

how shameful--
with my charcoal-stained
palms...

in careful bits
another thing of this floating world...
weighing charcoal

with my knee...

works fine

with elbows propped
on his abacus...
a siesta


1818

spread-eagle arms
legs opened wide...
siesta


1818

siesta work
for the stepchild...
picking brother's fleas

singing a song
and slapping his butt...
with a fan

once again summoning
Karasaki's rain...
the cuckoo


1818

the juggler's red
sleeve cord...
and a cuckoo


1818

Jiro, go to sleep!
the foolish cuckoo
sings too much


1818

for pure white flowers
it's the Fourth Month...
"cuckoo!"


1818

my eight-penny azaleas
are blooming...
"cuckoo!"


1818

the cuckoo
breaking in, shuts
me up

what a racket--
chase him! chase him!
cuckoo


1818

don't go! don't go!

when we quarrel
out you go!

in the west
battling like ancients monks
fireflies

the first firefly
deftly swerves away...
wind from my hand


1818

Bancho Town--
with all his might
the firefly flits


1818

firefly lights--
a turtle not called for
close at hand


1818

smack in the middle
of the Old Quarter...
fireflies


1818

on my sleeve
catching his breath...
worn-out firefly


1818

swatting prayer beads
at a pesky mosquito...

from the third column
of the mosquito swarm...
a sickle moon

unbroken from here
to the field

suddenly!

"Take a shortcut
through the hedge!"
the willow suggests

standing within
the green willow...
a warrior woman


1819

waving at the entrance
the friendly
willow


1819

smack in the middle
of Edo's very heart...
a willow

willow at the gate--
I part it with my head
going in

the willow
like a white cat...
a temple flower too

the willow
like a gray cat...
a temple flower too


1819

shrouding his rear
as he poops in the field...
a willow


1819

stirred by people's voices
the greening
willow


1819

with one gust
it becomes the perfect
willow


1819

at my gate
refusing to droop...

I've grown old enough
to love them

a new red flower
on the vine's tip

ink-stained hands
sweaty face...
the child's calligraphy!

at the eaves

a hot night--
among bags and burdens
they sleep

twinkling...

double back


1819

how many gateways
for the cool breeze?

in the cool air
slap! slap! his hair is combed...
Sir Horse

rainy season over--
two houses, two neighbors
sweeping soot


1819

the last
of the Fifth Month rain...
drip, drip


1819

in this darkness
don't get your nose picked!
Fifth Month rain

takes a day off
today

taken a day off
today?

maiden flowers looking
stuck-up...
Rain of the Tiger


1819

unknowingly wetting
an old man's sleeves...
Rain of the Tiger


1819

forgetting that today
is "the Rain of the Tiger"...
I'm drenched


1819

my hut, too
drenched by the Tiger's
tears


1819

lying down in a row--
discussing
the distant storm


1819

growing to the beat
of the cloudburst...
weeds


1819

rainstorm--
monk-like on a rock, under a tree
a minor official

on my sleeping mat
counting with my feet...

from peaks of clouds
to here

thanks to the wind
they are precious...

a twice-fired sake
induced ruckus...

1819

in this remote place
is it Saigyo's hut?
pure water over moss


1819

in this remote place
whose hut is it?
pure water over moss


1819

sluicing in
to fill the bath...
pure water


1819

letting pony drink
mother stands guard...
pure water


1819

the old mountain guard
prayed to find it...
trickle of pure water


1819

morning's first thing--
greedy eyes
on the green rice field


1819

this or that green rice field?
each farmer
is biased


1819

lying in a row--
he slanders his own
green rice field


1819

deutzia blossoms, too
on Buddha's birthday
report for duty

to the boat

again floats up
with an empty beak

in a new summer robe...
all alone

my summer room


1819

no divine punishment yet--
napping
under the net


1819

even the horses
sleep in light green
mosquito nets!


1819

curling to sleep--
in the paper mosquito net's window
a sickle moon


1819

this body of dust
suits this wispy-soft
paper mosquito net


1819

wringing hands
in the mosquito netting...
let me have just a corner!

1819

noisily demanding
a present...

on a man-made hill
celebrating...

"Your praying for rain's
ridiculous!"

1819

just when the calf
has fallen asleep...
the reed thrush sings


1819

just one reed
for the reed thrush...
take heart!

in ten days

the spoonbill takes
a vow of silence...

what delicateness!
a snake too sheds
his worldly robe

temple grounds--
a snake too sheds
his worldly robe

the snake strips
his clothes

the toad
rubs his head


1819

looking like
"I can ride the fog!"...
a toad

looking like
"I can ride the fog!"...
a crow

with that mouth
he could vomit a cloud...

of this thicket!"

seeking sanctuary
with a sigh of relief?

1819

teasing us
two or three times...
a firefly

though the hand is skillful
slips free


1819

first firefly--
uncaught by the hand
flies free


1819

flitting firefly--
uncaught by the hand
uncaught again!

though wrapped in
tissue paper...
a firefly's light


1819

toward people's voices
well, well!

firefly lights--
if you keep still
even on your head

do you think my sleeve
is your parent?
fleeing firefly


1819

measured by an inchworm
too...
my house's pillar


1819

today too

at sunset

up to heaven
the mosquito larva flies...

morning's mosquitoes--
behind Amida Buddha
they hide


1819

pesky mosquito--
into an old well
he sneaks


1819

to the lullaby
of mosquitoes
she sleeps


1819

a smattering of mosquitoes--
from today on
an old man's world


1819

this is cute too--
the year's first mosquito's
whiny voice


1819

making even the cherry tree
curse...
mosquitoes


1819

the whining mosquito
also thinks I'm old...
edge of my ear


1819

from the direction
of "all praise to Amida Buddha!"

first buzz
in the flame

and relentless!

first voice rising
in the evening sky...
a mosquito

where the verandah fly
rubbed his hands...
swat!


1819

secluded house--
even my flies
are few


1819

fly on my umbrella-hat
from today on
a citizen of Edo!


1819

the fly on my umbrella-hat
beats me
inside


1819

a lacquered tray--
whoops!
the fly slips


1819

one man, one fly
one large
sitting room


1819

my home village
where even the flies
bite deep


1819

it's a good world!
one more, help yourself
flies on my rice


1819

in a grassy meadow
she rubs them off...
cat's fleas


1819

don't jump flea!
that's Sumida River
over there


1819

if you jump flea
jump
on the lotus


1819

until the winged ants
come out
a fortunate pillar


1819

"Hey puppy
come here!" sings
a cicada


1819

a cicada chirrs--
the pinwheel so utterly
red


1819

first cicada
"Look at the floating world!
Look! Loo-ook!"


1819

cicada in the pine
how much will you cry
till it's noon?


1819

a mountain cicada--
into my sleeve
he goes


1819

from deep in the temple gong
a chirring
cicada


1819

dayflowers--
even at the ancient priest's
window


1819

day flowers--
burn amid steaming
pebbles

blowing his nose
on the moonflower...

measuring foot by foot
with a fan...

even the peony's
good karma wears thin...
my house!

a temple
in the Chinese style...
with peonies!


1819

blooming lotuses
in this world...
bent


1819

it's a better world--
but they're only penny-sized
lotus blossoms


1819

even lotus blossoms
bend a bit...
oh floating world!


1819

transferred to my gate
the little lotus
blossom


1819

blooming pink--
two pennies' worth of water
for your bath


1819

the pink
in the shade of stepmother trees
blooms


1819

even the horse's
hair is done up...
irises


1819

this morning
one's in the trash...
irises


1819

on the blooming duckweed
let us ride...
to that cloud!


1819

in the horse's ladle
the duckweed suddenly
has bloomed!


1819

planted in the garden
of the secluded house...
leftover rice plants


1819

roadside--
even the horse won't eat
the leftover rice plants


1819

secluded house--
using its pillar to thresh
the barley


1819

ripened barley--
with a child on her back
the sardine vendor


1819

a busy time--
even the mountain's moss
in full bloom


1819

the mountain moss
lends a hand
to the blooming


1819

red sacred rope--
the smallpox god's
crop of young bamboo


1819

a splendid, tall
young bamboo!
while I was away


1819

while I was away
just for a while...
a splendid young bamboo!


1819

well, well
pale purple, this year's color...
for young bamboo


1819

it's a good thing
being bitter bamboo...
fresh new shoots


1819

the thousand year
bamboo shoot...
snap! broken


1819

bamboo shoots--
if it weren't for people's "shoots"
you'd live to flower


1819

bitter bamboo shoots--
a lucky
assembly


1819

fancy sitting room--
even peeling melons
an ordeal

first melon of the season
in her grasp...

1819

aligned
with the sickle moon...

holding it
against her cheek...

showing off...

just one branch
helps my siesta...

the neighborhood's
relaxation spot...
the tree's deep shade

amid deutzia blossoms
all alone...
a shrine


1819

with deutzia blossoms
on this lucky day...
outhouse


1819

a deutzia shrub
even without blossoms...
for sale


1819

even the deutzia shrub
is moved to tears...
the toad's grave


1819

reflecting enough moonlight
to light my bedroom...
deutzia blossoms


1819

enough light
to light my bedroom...
deutzia blossoms


1819

first autumn morning--
a fever-curing
kind of sky


1819

a child writes
in the tray's ashes...
a cold night


1819

brushing away
the red horse's hard day...
a cold night


1819

since the day I knew
the word "Parent"...
cold nights


1819

our shameful shadows!
in the cold night walking
in vain


1819

shaking the empty keg
once again...
a cold night


1819

"Here's the outhouse!"
the horse calls...
a cold night


1819

in the mood for loafing
and carousing...
a cold night


1819

bowing to my home village
in my heart...
a cold night


1819

bowing to my children
in my heart...
a cold night


1819

the young folk
sleep together...
a cold night


1819

sweeping dirt
off the horse's back...
autumn dusk


1819

hugging his knees
his face at peace...
autumn dusk


1819

walking on alone
I write on a wall...
autumn dusk


1819

don't leave, geese!
wherever you live
it's autumn's dusk


1819

our shameful shadows!
in the long night walking
in vain


1819

autumn ends--
a man strokes away
his horse's troubles


1819

"Gimme that harvest moon!"
cries the crying
child


1819

guard my hut's key
pine tree!
going moon gazing


1819

a present for me--
moon gazing then locking
my hut


1819

the sake gone
time to buckle down
and moon-gaze


1819

buckwheat country's
sharp tongues cutting...
moon gazing


1819

in my home village
she guards our house...
moon gazing alone


1819

the harvest moon
draws near...
hole in the wall


1819

harvest moon--
fifty-seven years
of traveling autumns


1819

harvest moon--
she'd crawl to my dinner tray
if my child were here


1819

harvest moon--
my lap would be a pillow
if my child were here


1819

harvest moon--
leaving my hut's key
with the pine


1819

little house
in a rice barn's shadow...
here too, moon gazing


1819

Ishiyama--
a harvest moon eclipse
gazer


1819

eclipsed splendidly
as one would expect...
harvest moon


1819

night of the 15th--
a long wait
for darkness


1819

an officious one--
the harvest moon eclipse
gazer


1819

boldy he forecasts
the moon's
full eclipse


1819

in a flash
the moon's sickness
is cured


1819

returning to us
the great harvest moon!
harvest moon!


1819

before the moon does--
the crowd of people
wanes


1819

before the moon does--
people's faces
wane


1819

voices in the dark--
yet this is the night
of harvest moon


1819

to the world of man
the moon deigns
to return


1819

world of man--
even the moon
suffers!


1819

are you the harvest moon's
representative?
white rabbit


1819

the harvest moon
deigns to return...
floating world!


1819

ending the harvest moon
eclipse...
mountain rain


1819

such is our world--
even the moon
gets sick!


1819

the geese too
stuffing their bellies...
Ninth Month moon


1819

stuck in his winnow
chopsticks and a charm...
clear fall weather


1819

autumn wind--
the compass points
to my native mountains


1819

autumn wind--
red flowers she wanted
to pick


1819

pearls of dew--
even on my sleeves
rolling down


1819

a dewdrop pearl--
I pinched it into
a Buddha


1819

trying to pinch
a bead of dew...
a child


1819

this world
is a dewdrop world
yes... but...


1819

dew from a lotus leaf
plenty
for morning tea


1819

on lotus leaves
this world's dewdrops
are warped


1819

on lotus leaves
this world's dewdrops
are bent


1819

across the dried river
lightning
flickers


1819

in the lightning flash
rubbing his head...
toad


1819

in flashes of lightning
crossing the shaky
bridge


1819

lightning flash--
lying in a row at the gate
happy faces


1819

lightning--
streak by streak
cures the world


1819

little straw mat--
even on a one-penny bridge
fog rises


1819

evening fog--
the horse remembers
the bridge's hole


1819

writing the poem
on the mulberry substitute...
leaf of a loofah


1819

the eaves
of the holy man's hut...
plume grass


1819

out-dazzling
the harvest moon...
fireworks!


1819

a wind-break
for the nursing child...
scarecrow


1819

a rainy evening--
my next-door neighbor
pounding cloth


1819

setting a lantern
in the field...
someone pounding cloth


1819

hanging a lantern
in the pine...
evening cloth-pounding


1819

as water boiling...
Fifth Month rain


1820

departing the facing mountain
it comes this way...
little cloudburst


1820

with apologies
a cloudburst passes
by


1820

just now
two cloudbursts in a row...
that village yonder


1820

just wind
yet still a cloudburst
evening


1820

slipping down
into the lake...
billowing clouds


1820

flowing from the feet
of Goddess Kannon...
pure water


1820

even children
want to wear 'em!
pots on heads


1820

for just a little while
a sight to see...
evening's shrine boats


1820

Mr. Toad deigns
to creep out...
the shrine boat


1820

like this since
olden times?

mother's turn--
once more through
the purification hoop


1820

life in Edo--
from a second-floor window
summer's first banner


1820

from holy Jizo's
holy neck it hangs...
rice dumpling


1820

Mama tosses one
to teach her how...
rice dumpling


1820

the hooked nail
its hanging place...
rice dumpling


1820

her rice dumpling
doesn't resemble
the example


1820

young folk in bathrobes
well, well...
their idea of summer garb


1820

people of Kyoto
in parasol shade
drinking sake


1820

even for stealing water
for my rice field...
I take my parasol


1820

making her mother
hold it...
the parasol


1820

sleeping in new
mosquito nets...
horses of Edo


1820

even the poor
workhorses of Edo sleep...
in mosquito nets!


1820

dangling a mosquito net
I go out to eat...
evening's tea-and-rice


1820

forgive me please
rice field workers!
napping under the net


1820

the potted orchid
in the mosquito net
trembles


1820

under an umbrella-hat
curled up, asleep...
siesta


1820

under the bell
over the clapper...
a noon nap


1820

rice field ridge--
a one-rush mat
siesta shack


1820

one branch of the nettle tree
for shade...
siesta


1820

like the grownups
taking siestas...
a child pretends


1820

top to bottom
the mouse eats
the fan


1820

making me a fool
the mouse won't eat...
my paper fan


1820

living in comfort in Edo
his left hand
fanning


1820

for the blind priest's head
no
paper fan


1820

top to bottom
the mouse eats it...

1820

for the stepchild
only one paper fan...
mended


1820

using up one
incense stick...
mosquito smudge pot


1820

the in-law family
living in harmony...
evening cool


1820

though they bite
they're Kyoto mosquitoes...
evening cool


1820

night after night
the same faces...
cool air at the gate


1820

night after night
rejuvenation...
cool air at the gate


1820

shallow well--
the little fish's playmate
sweet jelly tub


1820

in a village
without birds
bats at dinnertime


1820

foolish bird--
after molting
what are you thinking?


1820

walking along
drying the paper umbrella...
"cuckoo!"


1820

in this darkness
don't get your nose picked!
cuckoo


1820

that way
the stones sing too!
cuckoo


1820

rain pours down--
a cuckoo
on Mount Machikane

in a palanquin to Yoshiwara
he flies!

you're nothing
but a crybaby!


1820

nightingale--
don't catch old age!
my house


1820

though wrapped
in a butterbur leaf...
firefly's light


1820

evicted
from the sunset bell...
firefly


1820

stumbling into
mosquito smudge smoke...
a firefly


1820

after leaving Kyoto
catching your breath?
first firefly


1820

first firefly
why the cold shoulder?
it's me!


1820

get out of Sin City
get out!
first firefly


1820

being an orphan
I cast no light...
firefly


1820

toward the calling voice
flying with gusto...
firefly


1820

do you think my sleeve
is grass?
crawling firefly


1820

O insects of summer
there's time yet
for lovemaking!


1820

my hut's lamp--
even moths don't come
to the flame


1820

don't strike
sunset's bell...
tiger moth


1820

to a hut with no lamp
hidden in trees
a tiger moth flits


1820

why is playing
with fire such fun...
tiger moth?


1820

fleeing the hell
of thicket ants...

and put them to bed, she leaves...

the Buddha takes leave
of Zenko Temple

morning cold--
on the fence the tea strainer's
shadow


1820

morning cold--
for the chrysanthemum too
a little hot water

in cold water
sipping the stars...

floating forth
on the morning dew

1820

if they were sweet
dewdrops, no doubt, would be
"mine" and "thine"

even on his arms
dewdrops
the tea seller

morning dew
more than enough
for face-washing


1820

is innocent

and the insects aren't sleeping
either

and my feet

in the thicket
the old deer calls
for honor's sake

make music
in this world


1820

O insects
don't you complain too!
this autumn


1820

for singing insects
complaining
is a feat


1820

the singing insects
so prone
to complaining!


1820

in this world
among insects too...

early, so early
turns sour

from this year on
in my left hand, umbrella-hat
in the right, knapsack

we start the spring
in our everyday clothes...
me and the sparrow

spring begins--
on the hut's unlucky side
a grave

spring begins--
the obligatory
sparrows at the gate

is idle

yanking up a little pine
he says
a prayer


1821

even for the man
pooping in the field...

1821

sending a "Happy
New Year!"
down the fox's hole

my New Year's greeting
is answered...

a good man--
crossing a mountain to say
"Happy New Year!"


1821

New Year's gate greetings--
on each side of the road
tracks of sandals

"Happy New Year!"
at the gate, tossing the cat
a present

reading it to discover
the price of rice...
