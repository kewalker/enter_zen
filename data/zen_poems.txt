Sharing a Mountain Hut with a Cloud

A lonely hut on the mountain-peak towering above a thousand others;

One half is occupied by an old monk and the other by a cloud:

Last night it was stormy and the cloud was blown away;

After all a cloud could not equal the old man's quiet way.

Kuei-tsung Chih-chih, a monk who lived in a humble hut on Lu-shan (?? Rozan)

"he aptly gives vent to his appreciation of Emptiness; the verse is not to be understood as merely describing his solitary hut where he lived in company with clouds." (Essays in Zen Buddhism – Second Series 351-2)

Without Name and Form

Well versed in the Buddha way,

I go the non-Way

Without abandoning my

Ordinary person's affairs.

The conditioned and

Name-and-form,

All are flowers in the sky.

Nameless and formless,

I leave birth-and-death.

P'ang Yün (?? Hõ Un)

 

Mind at Peace

When the mind is at peace,

the world too is at peace.

Nothing real, nothing absent.

Not holding on to reality,

not getting stuck in the void,

you are neither holy or wise, just

an ordinary fellow who has completed his work.

P'ang Yün (?? Hõ Un) (The Enlightened Heart 34)

 

Being as Is

Food and clothes sustain

Body and life;

I advise you to learn

Being as is.

When it's time,

I move my hermitage and go,

And there's nothing

To be left behind.

P'ang Yün (?? Hõ Un)

 

The Ultimate Attainment

The past is already past.

Don't try to regain it.

The present does not stay.

Don't try to touch it.

From moment to moment.

The future has not come;

Don't think about it

Beforehand.

Whatever comes to the eye,

Leave it be.

There are no commandments

To be kept;

There's no filth to be cleansed.

With empty mind really

Penetrated, the dharmas

Have no life.

When you can be like this,

You've completed

The ultimate attainment.

P'ang Yün (?? Hõ Un)

Emptiness Poem

Old P'ang requires nothing in the world:

All is empty with him, even a seat he has not,

For absolute Emptiness reigns in his household;

How empty indeed it is with no treasures!

When the sun is risen, he walks through Emptiness,

When the sun sets, he sleeps in Emptiness;

Sitting in Emptiness he sings his empty songs,

And his empty songs reverberate through Emptiness:

Be not surprised at Emptiness so thoroughly empty,

For Emptiness is the seat of all the Buddhas;

And Emptiness is not understood by the men of the world,

But Emptiness is the real treasure:

If you say there's no Emptiness,

You commit grave offence against the Buddhas.

????? The body is the tree of enlightenment.

????? The mind is the stand of a bright mirror.

????? Wipe it constantly and with ever-watchful diligence,

????? To keep it uncontaminated by the worldly dust.           Shen-hsiu

????? Since it is not a thing at all,

????? Where could it be contaminated by dust?          Hui-neng

(The Golden Age of Zen 60, 300 n.5)

 

The body is the Bodhi tree,                                       Bodhi by nature is no tree,

The mind is like a mirror.                            The mirror is inherently formless.

Every now and then dust and polish it,  There is originally nothing,

And let no dust settle on it.                                       On what, then, can the dust settle?

(Two Zen Classics 160-1)

 

The body is like unto the Bodhi-tree,                   Neither is there Bodhi-tree,

And the mind to a mirror bright;               Nor yet a mirror bright;

Carefully we cleanse them hour by hour            Since in reality all is void,

Lest dust should fall upon them.              Whereon can the dust fall?

(The Spirit of Zen 37)

 

The body is the tree of enlightenment,   Enlightenment is basically not a tree,

And the mind like a clear mirror stand;  And the clear mirror not a stand.

Time and again wipe it diligently,                          Fundamentally there is not a single thing—

Don't let it gather dust.                                  Where can dust collect?

The body is the bodhi-tree,                                        Bodhi is actually not a tree,

The mind is like the mirror bright.                        The mind not a mirror bright.

Clean it diligently every time,                                  Buddha nature is always tranquil,

Do not ever let dust alight.                                       Wherefore can dust alight?

(The Complete Book of Zen 81)

 

The body is the tree of wisdom,                Wisdom never had a tree,

the mind a bright mirror in its stand.                    the bright mirror lacks a stand.

At all times take care to keep it polished,           Fundamentally there is not a single thing—

never let the dust and grime collect!                     where could the dust and grime collect?

"For many years Shuho had been unable to meditate in the full lotus position because of a crippled leg. When he felt death approaching, he broke his leg with his own hands and took the full lotus. Then, despite agonizing pain, he wrote his final words and died with the last stroke of the brush." (Samadhi 41)

 

Bright Pearl

??????         There is a bright pearl within me,

??????         Buried for a long time under dust.

??????         Today, the dust is gone and the light radiates,

??????         Shining through all the mountains and rivers.

Master Yueh of Ch'a-ling (???) (The Golden Age of Zen 248, 322 n.7)

Master Yueh of Ch'a-ling "came to his enlightenment when he slipped and fell in crossing a bridge, and that he hit off a very wonderful gatha on the occasion." (The Golden Age of Zen 248)

 

??????         I have one jewel shining bright,

??????         Long buried it was under worldly worries;

??????         This morning the dusty veil is off and restored is its lustre,

??????         Illuminating rivers and mountains and ten thousand things.

Between Heaven and Earth

????? The spring mountains covered with layers of most variegated colors,

????? And the spring streams fancifully laden with the reflecting images.

????? Standing by himself between heaven and earth,

????? Facing infinitude of beings.

The Essence

???????    One, seven, three, five.

???????    What you search for cannot be grasped.

???????    As the night deepens, the moon brightens over the ocean.

???????    The black dragon's jewel is found in every wave.

                                         Looking for the moon, it is here in this wave and the next.

A verse that master Hsueh-t'ou Ch'ung-hsien wrote for a disciple

 

One, seven, three, five.

What you search for cannot be grasped.

As the night deepens,

the moon brightens over the ocean.

The black dragon's jewel

is found in every wave.

Looking for the moon,

it is here in this wave

and the next.

Huai's Poem of Enlightenment

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven—

Yes, many thousand feet high is the mountain peak, and lo, someone stands there on one leg;

He has carried away the gem from the dragon's jaws,

And Vimalakîrti's secrets he holds in one word.

Detached

Be detached, be detached!

Be thoroughly detached!

What then?

The pine is green,

And white is the snow.

Monks sit peacefully among the trees,

Ridding themselves of illusion with a calm mind.

Quietly realizing enlightenment,

They experience a joy that is beyond that of heaven.

Laymen seek fame and profit,

Or fine robes, seats, and bedding.

Though the joy in getting them is only fleeting,

They are untiring in their quest.

Monks, however, beg for food in humble robes,

Their daily actions being one with the Way.

With their Wisdom-eye opened

They realize the essence of the Law.

Gathering all together to listen

To the countless Buddhist teachings,

They leave behind the world of illusion,

Quietly enveloped in enlightenment's Wisdom.

Light Itself

Dwell!

You are Light itself.

????? What is the use of toiling and moiling so?

A gâthâ by Hui-neng, T'an-ching (Essays in Zen Buddhism – First Series 216)

 

????? When alive, one keeps sitting without lying down:

????? When dead, one lies down without sitting up.

????? In both cases, a set of stinking bones!

????? What has it to do with the great lesson of life?

(The Golden Age of Zen 82, 302 n.38)

 

????? A living man who sits and does not lie down,

????? A dead man who lies down and does not sit!

Quietitude

Here rules an absolute quietness, all doings subside;

Just a touch, and lo, a roaring thunder-clap!

A noise that shakes the earth, and all silence;

The skull is broken to pieces, and awakened I am from the dream!

One with It

Long seeking it through others,

I was far from reaching it.

Now I go by myself;

I meet it everywhere.

It is just I myself,

And I am not itself.

Understanding this way,

I can be as I am.

Ch'an master Tung-shan Ling-chia (???? Tõsan Ryõkai, 807-869) (Two Zen Classics 267)

 

Do not seek from another,

Or you will be estranged from self.

I now go on alone,

Finding I meet It everywhere.

It now is I,

I now am not It.

One should understand in this way

To merge with suchness as is. (Transmission of Light 38)

A Death Verse

I rebuke the wind and revile the rain,

I do not know the Buddhas and patriarchs;

My single activity turns in the twinkling of an eye,

Swifter even than a lightning flash.

(Zen Buddhism: A History, Japan, 40)

 

Old Pan Kou

Old Pan Kou knows nothing about time

and nothing about space has well.

His life is self-natured and self-sufficient.

He needs to ask for nothing outside of his own being.

The genesis of the world is the exercise of his mind.

When his mind starts to think, the world starts to move.

The world has never been made by any special desing.

Neither has an end ever been put to it.

The Song of Pan Kou

 

Contentment

????      As the pines grew old and the clouds idled

????      He found boundless contentment within himself.

Babo, preface to The Record of Lin-chi (Lin-chi Lu ???/Rinzairoku)

(Zen Word, Zen Calligraphy 127)

 

Mind and Senses

The mind is an organ of thought and objects are set against it:

The two are like marks on the surface of the mirror;

              When the dirt is removed, the light begins to shine.

Both mind and objects being forgotten, Ultimate Nature

              reveals itself true.

Free Spirit

Every day I'm either in a wine shop or a brothel,

A free-spirited monk who is hard to fathom;

My surplice always appears torn and dirty,

But when I patch it, it smells so sweet.

Forgetting the Self

To learn Buddha Dharma is to learn the self.

To learn the self is to forget the self.

To forget the self is to become one with

endless dimension, Universal Mind.

This is Our World

We eat, excrete, sleep, and get up;

This is our world.

All we have to do after that–

Is to die.

Dõka (way song/poem) by Zen master Ikkyû Sojun (????) (The Way of Zen 162)

"In Japan, wandering monks are called unsui—literally, 'cloud and water'—as a reminder to be always floating and flowing. Ikkyu himself took the moniker Kyoun, or 'Crazy Cloud,' to describe his eccentric, nonconformist style of zen. (In Japan, the word kyo has connotations of bravery and high intention, of living outside the rules in order to retain the spirit of the rules.) He called his collected poems the 'Crazy Cloud Anthology.' " (Zen Sex 148) Crazy cloud (?? Kyõun)

 

Selflessness

Misery only doth exist, none miserable,

No doer is there; naught save the deed is found.

Nirvâna is, but not the man who seeks it.

The Path exists, but not the traveller on it.
