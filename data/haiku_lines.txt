on New Year's Day
a cute little pilgrim
at the gate
New Year's Day
this world of Japan's
blossoms
basking
in the New Year's sun...
my trashy hut
around noon
New Year's Day begins...
little hut
no run-of-the-mill
New Year's Day
for the slob
First Month, second day--
my wrinkled
hands
First Month--
recording the cash spent
on sake
on the cat's grave
in First Month...
dried sardines
to one side
of my paper lantern...
spring's first dawn
at my hut
what will come of it?
spring's first dawn

to sweep
amazing--
in the house I was born

amazing--
in the house I was born
spring begins today
even for this body of dust
a guardian god!
blossoming spring
now begins
the Future Buddha's reign...
spring pines
spring at my hut--
tall as a sleeping man
the mist
spring begins
as it has deigned to do
for a thousand ages

even the smoke
an ancient thing
spring begins--
sparrows at my gate
with healthy faces
from where the gods live

sunrise
from a neighbor's storehouse
shining slantwise...

rising into
the year's first sky...

if it's not raining
it's the year's first sky!
tomorrow too, travel
forming the year's
first sky...

welcoming in loads
of new year's rain...

big field--
my New Year's walk
follows holes made by canes
O New Year's god
this year too
send help!
plum blossoms fall
in the hairdo...
lowering the basket

hauling up the basket
through branches

drawn by the uproar
to Ueno

the mountain festival
ended yesterday
on the homecoming servant's
face too...
peach blossoms
Servants' Holiday--
two in a row
on Meditation Bridge
yanking up a little pine
he watches
the watchers
in formal trousers
curled asleep on the lawn...
first day of Rat
pruned by the antelope's
jaws...
New Year's pine
here and there
hanging in the thicket...
New Year's ropes
going outside
plum blossoms dive in...
my lucky tea
my shadow too
in good health...
"Happy New Year!"
my ramshackle hut
just as it is...
"Happy New Year!"
how many times
a New Year's gift?
the fan returns
my humble hut--
all morning they come
for New Year's gifts
New Year's gift of tea--
where did you go
on your journey back to me?

attempts first...
year's first writing
treasured child--
his cane dragging
the year's first writing

even in mountain shade

into the year's first
water softly...

at the whining cat...
bouncing her ball

'round and 'round...

hugging his kite
soon he's sound asleep...

from his mouth

meal...the cat wins
and laughs

through a fence
the grass and wheat
tottering...
sunlight stretches on

on spring's last day...
laughing face
spring departs--
the old clothes buyer
ignores me

by the road
the little crow
slips so cleverly...

taking it easy
the mouse sleeps too...

half of it
is flitting snowflakes...

walking along
out of the dyer's-weed
it blows...

passing through
passing through
a lucky fox
deigns to bark...

rap-a-tap
who's that coming
in the mist?
today too, today too
living in mist...
little house
in the misty day
not growing older...
grave tablets
in spring mist
from morning on a ruckus...
foolish crow
misty day--
behind the big inn
a pine
farewell! farewell!

in the mist
well hidden
by the spring mist...

lost in mist...

by the dog

turns green
heading for my sleeve
to play...

laid off...

some stay behind
in the green leaves...

the crane and the tortoise's
playground...

windblown clouds--
the fires of burning fields
bring sunset
when this pine sapling
grows to flower...
who'll be here?

comes home

licking his chops
comes home
on his whisker tips

a pheasant cries
the bright moon in raindrops
from the eaves...

flying fast as he can
returns
up to today
such perserverance and strength!
returning geese
up to today
such great perserverance...

with a butterfly...

on butterbur leaves...

yet some people
are tired of it

in bloom!

side by side with the boat
a Heike crab
counting mountains
like the ones back home...

of harvest moon!

die out again...

it dances full fury...

the autumn gale blowing
the soles of my feet
just the other day
we said goodbye...
dewy grave
in the silver dew
one sleeve cold...
morning sun
if someone asks
answer: it's a dewdrop
OK?
unaware of life
passing like dewdrops...
they frolic
even among silver
dewdrops...
some big, some little
lightning flash--
in plume grass ensconced
a fifty year-old's face
the lightning flash
makes someone cry...

from the tree

have bloomed in a flash

summons his mother
clapping

brings the broom
stoking it
to find my shoes...

for just a little while...

is filled...

his father
must be watching
protecting the camphor tree
too...

like people

can't be found

ashamed
when I ask the way
to Obasute...

an abundance
of cooking smoke...
evening cloth-pounding
cloth-pounding near
cloth-pounding far...
a rainy night
into the grass
at the shrine, pouring...

on the mountain a deer
calls his wife
making a duet
with my flute...
cry of a deer
solitude--
that song the shrike
is singing!
a shrike sings--
rain puddles dry
on the back road
geese landing--
the farmer's field too
a famous site
celestial geese--
none of them come down
to my pine
geese at my gate--
another seductive rain
falls today
geese descend--
the ancient rushes
a famous site
geese honking--
this damned year, too

the titmice split
to the left and right...

atop the moon's head

the insect's song
on the paper door
lingers
still singing
the insect drifts away...

the bagworm
sings a song dangling
from a branch
the bagworm
sings a song...
"I love rice cake!"

makes a halo!

the town is buzzing
with dragonflies
the dragonfly's
100 prayer pilgrimage...

umbrella-hat is loaded...
with locusts
rustle, rustle
leaping at my shins...

in the water bowl...

a connoisseur
laugh at my piss
and shudder...

when I die
guard my grave

with a red flower

don't get hoarse

looks as if he's listening...
earthworms sing
in a little nook
basking in the sun...
hermit chrysanthemum
the smell of sake
around about dusk...
chrysanthemum
cat's bell--
in the long night the chrysanthemum
has bloomed
the emaciated chrysanthemum
totters
into bloom
for the big
chrysanthemum too
autumn ends quickly
morning-glories
softly floating...
in the teacup
the shrine's bell
jingles, a morning-glory
blooms
shaking her body
in the summer rain...
maiden flower
woven into
the deer fence...
bush clover blooms
mountain field--
blooming buckwheat's whiteness
makes me shiver
it's cold!
a cicada in the eaves
with hot peppers
plumes of plume grass--
the thin hearts
swishing
evening's fall colors--
the rainbow in the valley
fades away
to a place
the cool air missed...
a leaf falls
the roasted rice cake
wrapped for luck...
paulownia leaf
splendidly blooming
en masse, midday's
roses of Sharon
a splendid mountain home
and roses
of Sharon

reaches the valley...
roses of Sharon
butterflies never
tire of them...
roses of Sharon
roses of Sharon--
the hedge too good
for the house
such roses of Sharon!
yet the village
looks empty

too good for the house
they bloom

after cutting
the loofah vine...

down the mountain?

fire is rising...

and the great temple hall
is ceiling-less

he can't find his roost
the evening crow
stone still
he lets the snow fall
colt in the pasture
falling snow--
yesterday it wasn't there
"House for Rent" sign
looking delicious

softly
keeping the beat
of the prayer to Buddha...

stuck in his winnow
chopsticks and a charm...
hailstones
a mirage running
and hiding...

on my hut's wall

are separated...

turns back to her children
turns back...
at Basho's grave
beginning with a prayer...

in the winter quilt..

winter quilt!

to put them on

wriggles in butt-first...

draws near our fire...

soon fans
are flitting
making a face
he turns down the pufferfish soup...
teaching the children
hey wren!
do you realize it's Ninth Month
30th day?
if I just whisper
the flock of plovers
bursts into flight
cold--
the withered grasses
with prickles
my gate--
just four or five radishes
in store
still I see them
how they were...

fallen
in the tofu tub
borrowing the umbrella-hat

into the fence...

in bloom

sets in

safe and sound...

like me!

from meeting rooms
of pine and bamboo...

vendors
spring breeze--
the pine on the ridge
whispers it
when will we meet again?
I'm off to the phosphorescent fires
in the far mist
white clouds of mist
blow away...
the village's mountain
turning into white waves
at night?
the far mist
the plowman stacks
volcanic rocks...
evening
sea foam--
in the fleeting wave
a Heike crab
cutting off my hair
like a blossom-viewing party!
wicker umbrella-hat
having a father and a mother
he stays home...

have celestial maidens
descended to earth?

creeping through white
cherry blossom clouds...

among the crags
under the storm...

to the sky

cracking...

a sight for sore eyes
first frost--
one hates buckwheat noodles
one loves 'em
an old man's ways--
my backside warmed
by the wood fire
a wood fire--
her shadow in the window
pulling thread
warming up
straw-wrapped fried rice...
my wood fire
a windbreak
in the winter withering...

of firewood
from crappy ground
to the plum tree

a place for straw
I too celebrate
with zoni...

until only mist
opening the window
I see the butterfly off...
into the field

and the willow
together trembling

across a puddle
my walking stick
sends the trash floating...

the hated barnyard grass
rears its head...

falling from the eaves they swarm...

while looking
at poppies, poppies...

where that rainbow
starts from
in the dewy field
one sleeve cold...

of hailstones

at the bathhouse door
knocking

in black paper

with sesame sake...

off on a journey
I'm not alone...

the servants
all are new...

lucky direction walk...
to cherry blossoms
houses here and there

out of green leaves
then back in

has splashed the kite...
it seems
pounding the seven herbs
doesn't drown him out...
crow
spring peace--
after rain, a gang war
garden sparrows
spring peace--
the rained-on field's
morning smoke
waking up--
the spring rain hasn't cleared
the day hasn't ended

pilgrims on their way
to rites for the dead
in hazy night
stepping into water...
losing my way
morning mist--
the castle's shutters
bang open
at the gate
how many thousands of bushels
of far mist?
drawing water
it's tepid...
nostalgia for olden times
duckweed is first
to float...
rice-seedling bed
when did they go?
all the swallows' nests
empty
larks in the sky
people in the sea...
a holiday
frogs sing, roosters sing
the east
turns light
a butterfly my companion
through Nana Field
we wander
lying down
with a visiting butterfly...
outer hot spring
amid the white
of the whitebait
duckweed's green
Heike crabs--
long ago they moon-gazed here
on boats
resigning himself
to this oceanless province...
pond snail
wisteria in bloom--
voices of pilgrims
voices of birds
plum blossom scent--
when I open my paper door
a bright moon
for the plum blossom moon
I remove
a rain shutter
I view three masters
of the original style...
plum blossom inn
there comes a time
even in blossoming Kyoto...
sick of it
to my upturned face
as I pray, blossoms
drip down
amid his grave's
blossoms I bow...
missing him
distant mountain--
looking at the blossoms
then hurrying on my way
divine providence--
throughout Japan gods
guarding blossoms
peach blossoms and willow
decorate the eaves...
blossom viewing
rain on the eaves--
the potted cherry tree
calm and still
an off-the-cuff haiku
for a poor crop...
mountain cherry blossoms
turning 'round
just missing a pretty woman...
willow tree
Fifth Month rain--
the five thousand five hundredth
rented umbrella
far distance--
above green rice fields
three mountains
the cormorants stare
at them hard...

also changing
into a summer robe...
my journey's lice
my new summer robe
splashed by hot
purification water
for the potted bamboo
and me...

has a cuckoo!
the weary cormorant
sees off the cuckoo
in the sky
temporary shrine--
acting like he owns it
a snail

the baddest of bad boys
bare-chested
vast sky
vast earth
autumn passes too
under dewy umbrella-hat
nodding off...

looking small...
mist
birds and people
creeping through...
cherry blossoms

all start honking...
a cold night
like the others
on tatami mats...

welcomes its falling...

with straw sandals on...

from the nose
of the sudden riser...

of the pure-minded priests...

sounds like Ueno's...

over Mount Miwa...
pitch black
cherry blossoms--
over there an edge
of Old Japan

over there an edge
of Old Japan
in cool air
slicing the falling rain...

a weary cloud
hangs over

coming to see my house
the morning sun
in the thick weeds
same as yesterday...

while calling fireflies
crossing his profile...
a firefly
in an alley
beating fleas off a mat...

it's dawn
leaving now
is especially hard...

though Mount Obasute
is hateful...
pure water

how long will the cold wind
blast?
by the hearth
last night, his smile
was farewell
up to yesterday
I saw you every day...
New Year's herbs
in the blossoms
calling to me clumsily...
a little bird
it seems to wash
the summer mountains...

mostly rice planters
on the ferry

over green fields

returns
cuckoo--
today I'm in good spirits
too

today, as he sleeps
for the last time

of pestering...

at my feet
when did you get here?

is steaming...

from the eaves
flecked with sand
from the whirlwind...

removing my skullcap--
at everywhich gate

for the moment
straight above my pillow...

gone without a trace...

for my neighbor's pear tree...

of her candy stick...

for the first time...

entrusting it
to the green willow...

with paper fan
sweeping off three drops
of rain in passing...

in morning-glories...

holding
such a pretty fan...

in moonlight...

holding a lantern
tidying up...

in the foot-tall bamboo
night after night...

speak of the devil!
a snipe takes flight...
evening cool
one tree
one farmer's field...
evening cool
even if I touch her
this tree rejects me...
evening cool
planting a pine too
for after I die...
evening cool
if you get too close
the nettle tree will curse you!
evening cool

going too far
into the thick of thorns...

keeping her appointment
to enjoy evening's cool air...

brazen with people
who come and go...

lingering
under the paper umbrella...

dawn--
from atop the wheat
"cuckoo!"
on a low branch
a child's imitation...
mountain cuckoo
so is haiku hell
over that-a-way...
mountain cuckoo?
from the fir tree too
two are singing...
mountain cuckoos
reed thrush--
the cow doesn't answer
his question
lit by the mosquito-murdering
taper...
my white hair
a mosquito
all day it whines...
by my pillow
left out all night
the tofu gleams...
mosquitoes whisper
swatting a fly
looking at
a mountain
the grasses' fleas
pitter-patter move...
lamplight's shade
while the floating island
moves along...
cicada chorus
the moonflowers
strike it rich!
the stars
moonflowers--
one by one the wind
rustles them
heat shimmers
on top of heat shimmers...
poppies
the tall pines
end up sunburned
O poppies!
from the day they bloomed
drenched by rain...
poppies
among the footprints
of the warriors...
poppies
the gatekeeper's
side-field...
let the poppies bloom!
at dawn
not a soul in sight...
lotus blossoms
in the white lotuses
two or three strands
of willow
even in the mouth
of the gutter pipe...

the scent of lotuses
in the back
house on a hill
against the mountain pine
they're blown...

staring at me
on and on...

just when the young bamboo
starts to straighten...

eggplants
growing where
the seedling seller passed...

one more day
of leafy shade for you...

on the gate's post
where the pony is tied...
fresh green leaves
for the second day
the same big snake...
thick summer grasses
every day
four or five fall...
Sleeping Tree's blossoms
the green plum
also accepts the feeling
of the ant
groping for plums--
the frog on the branch
is magnanimous
autumn cold--
wherever I go people
have homes
paying no heed
to morning's cold...
shoots of rice
he checks the bamboo
with concern...
morning cold
beating the empty
straw bag--nothing!
a cold night
while leaning on it
it's turned chilly...
the post
alone he cries
the motherless bird...
autumn dusk
even the pine tree
I planted grows old!
autumn dusk
"It's a foolishly long
night!" I say
in the long night
the pine wind
blows in my ear...
a long night
Milky Way--
maybe the fools of Kyoto
are crying
a cloud zigzags
above where I lie...
Milky Way
a clear view
in the soup kettle...
Milky Way
some places up there
look deep...
Milky Way
where will my star
stop for the night?
Milky Way
the defeated wrestler, too
joins the crowd...

comes tomorrow...

beyond the stubble...

his home village...

its mouth open
waiting for mother...

what's your home village like
rice field goose?

lamplight glimmers
on my knees...

on four or five
slender blades of grass

even the pine tree
looks rustic...

blows as if it knows
I'm an orphan

rejoice!

shining up
the evening moon...

is autumn
clinging to the lord's
umbrella-hat too...

a wrinkled face
he's my age...
lanterns for the dead
Bon lanterns--
yesterday's tiles
today are weeds
stopping to watch
three, two...
lanterns for the dead
in pine-tree shade
the one who doesn't dance
ivory white
the sound of oars
lingers...
good stars tonight
for the fisherman's
rising smoke too...

on the tournament...

sitting in front
his father's face...

even the scarecrow
turns his back to it...

in one ear a bell
on the ridge, someone pounding cloth
in the evening

in the night...
rain on the nettle tree
her mouth and hands
not like everyone's...

the flood was exactly
a year ago...

dangling from
the young buck's antler
weeds
the little crow
is snubbed...

another year
they're back for the massacre...
rice field geese
flying south
for the slaughter?

in the flock...

on the neighbor's house
where smoke rises...

and smoke...

for her "pregnancy stick"...

at Sumiyoshi
all through the low tide...

waited so long
for the low tide...

with a rooster crowing...

in the face

dug up too
before me

for the coast, camellias
blooming
surveying also

than the pine...

in Katsushika...

from branches that block
the wind...

half of it showing
in the deep grass...
peony
for the green willow
night rushes in...

in a big swamp
just one bloom...
but it's a lotus!
sparrows bathing
have scattered it...

shines down...

in deutzia blossoms

in solitude
walking on oyster shells...

I thought by now this journey
would've ended
from the roof's overhang
three drops...
first autumn morning
a cold morning--
but the same pine tree
as last year
facing the gate
of elder brother...
a cold night
a pounding pestle
completes the scene...
a cold night
the field's smoke
crawls into my sleeves...
a cold night
autumn evening--
from elsewhere another horse
neighs in reply
even the pestle
becomes part of the scene...
a long night
every time I go out
the horse neighs...
a long night
Tone River's
farewell to autumn...
bright moon
cawing in the tree
are you a widow, crow?
Milky Way above
shaded by thicket--
the moon breaks through...
my house

on a clear, rainless night
elsewhere!

watching the bridge
as evening falls...

at my wrinkled hands...

sizes me up

come from the Mountain
of Swords?

on my pilgrimage
to which hell?

puts on a show...

next to the fence

in the cauldron
an autumn gale
travelers set out
the sun rises...
a world of morning dew

the river beach's pinks
barely visible
when the fog clears
a mountain...
of fire chips
from a hand that holds
a bucket of sacred branches...
fog rises
from a hand
pricked by sacred shikimi...
fog rises
even at a house
shrouded in mountain fog...
a festival
my dear one's house
behind it a field
of flowers
tiny sandals
made of red paper...
for the ancestor
when the bell tolls
for the ancestors...
dewdrops scatter
the Bon Festival
flickers out too...
lanterns for the dead

for the tree-less gate

in mountain shade
but a festival dance!

in a reed mat

isn't left out...

a sakaki tree planted
for good luck...
cloth-pounding

when he starts to make love
mountain rain
his dying place
fairly well thatched...

sing, quail!
if my hut bothers you
I'll close it
all people must
grow old...

will I grow old
like you?

don't be bewildered
by the cold weather!

in bloom...

and it's drenched...

the bird flies off
making a mental note...
the big gourd
in the gloom of night
bit by bit it grows...

a good dream
for the year's end?

just thatched yesterday...

for Buddha...

is lonely...

spring rain--
there's one window
per person
through a window big
as an umbrella-hat...
spring breeze
spring breeze--
the mop on the fence
drying
spring breeze--
let the grass also
drink sake!
temple mountain--
under a spring moon heading
to a poem party
every evening
in raindrops from the eaves...
spring moon
bit by bit
more haze, more moon...
secluded temple
in the misty day
no window can be seen...
a prison
misty day--
grasses at the gate
at noon
on one sleeve
rain pitter-patters...
spring mist
fat little sparrows
in the farm field too...
in mist
spring mist--
not taking up a hoe
a shameless loafer
Musashi Plain--
our dwelling too
in mist
draping the mountain
village's sleeping face...
mist
heat shimmers--
the mosquito-breeding thicket
is pretty too
in my dear one's house
not one provincial doll
on Doll's Day
my home village--
even the doll's face
made of weeds
their colorful umbrellas
fluttering...
low tide
plowing the rice field
dewdrops fall too...
entrance gate
plowing fields--
festivals, festivals
all over!
back road--
even on top of grasses
sowing herbs
mountain field--
"Nice job of seeding!"
sing the birds
the nightingale aims
and arrives...
my fence
mountain crows
bring the mountain nightingales
when you come
hey nesting swallows--
grassy green mountains
are elsewhere
flying swallows--
wherever there's grass
hail Great Japan!
entrusting the thicket
to the field crow...
the lark sings
Mount Ashigara's
mountain pheasant,
celebrate the haze!
hilltop pheasant
are you jealous of the heron's
style?
around noon, squawking
the pheasant walks
through town
even in mountain shade
a plowed field!
the pheasant cries
geese fly north--
how they yearn to see
Mount Sarashina
the geese I know
by sight, are they gone?
rice field of Nara
frogs croaking--
"This rain on the grass
is unsanctioned!"
in Adashi Field
the butterflies seem
sinless
behind me a butterfly
west toward Matsuhara
crawls
O goddess Ichihime
smile!
a meadow butterfly
casting a spell
on the man...
meadow butterflies
in Katsushika
even in the outhouse...

for not being ready...
sunset bell
straggly violets--
here, too
the moon's dwelling
a swish-swish
deep in the thicket...
flowering mustard
flowering mustard
drapes the back...
my home
in the thicket no one
knows about
trees budding bright
springtime
yet it blooms reluctantly...
the camellia
my home village--
even lying-down cows
look at camellias
in plain old everyday
plains and fields...
plum blossoms!
may the wind send
this plum blossom scent
to Kyoto!
plum blossom scent--
even the weasel passes
with a song
wrapped in the scent
of plum blossoms...
little house
plum blossom scent--
through a needle's eye
the light
even weeds under the tree
smell nice...
plum blossoms
mountain village--
wiping greasy hands
on plum blossoms
that dog ought to poop
pure gold!
blossom shade
scattering blossoms--
today too
like olden times
up close
even the cherry blossoms of Ueno
pass on
cherry blossoms--
I also hear a temple bell
from my twenties
in cherry blossom shade
there are even those
who hate this world
from now on
cherry blossom solitude!
my window
on Mount Ubasute
where the old were left to die...
cherry blossoms
most end up
stuck in mud...
cherry blossoms
an idler--
under the cherry blossoms
I live
even in sleep
pigeons come to coo...
cherry blossoms
no one says
"First cherry blossoms!"
my humble hut
cherry trees in bloom
with no crowds...
castle mountain
all night
under the cherry blossoms
nagging
vacant temple--
industriously blooming
peach and cherry
Japan's night sky
has become
all willows
lined up
with the evening mountain...
a willow
in summer's early dawn
a nettle tree...
back window
in summer's early dawn
a bird comes chirping...
nettle tree
the moon shining--
no carousing
this summer night!
evening cool--
for each little village
one little hill
evening cool--
a Buddha of healing
in a thicket
in a cloudburst
another festival shrine
passes by
rainstorm--
hanging over the village
that doesn't pray
rainstorm--
a wildflower blooms
at my pillow
only when a scrap of cloud
billows to form peaks...
then to bed
when I go back to sleep
it quickly forms peaks...
little cloud
at my humble hut, too
celebration smoke
for green rice fields
an arm for a pillow
imagining the green rice field
is mine
Buddha's birthday--
fat little sparrows
and their parents
picking flowers--
everyone with a different
style of fan
a butterfly deigns
to come and dance...
summer flowers
a cool wind today
the first of the month...
Mount Fuji
irises on the eaves--
before they shrivel
to bed I go

at the low-tide beach
a "Good fortune!" wish
even for the pigweed...

one ear covered
with my paper fan

is good

in the burning house?

mountain cuckoo--
the cherry blossoms of Shinano
have bloomed!
when you step one foot
on the mountain...
mountain cuckoo
my hut's firefly
still hasn't starved
to death
skinny firefly
on the big boat's mast
clinging
my house
where the town's fireflies
hide out
my gate--
lodging for the fireflies
there being no grass
in my thicket
at the end of their time...
fireflies
a thing to celebrate!
the mosquitoes of Kazusa
feast on me too
everything has burned
even the blameless
mosquitoes
while swatting a fly
today again...
the mountain temple bell
sharing the sunset
with the pony...
a snail
one little tub
one lotus
one evening falls
lotus blossoms--
the beggar's smoke
wafts over
among lotus blossoms
the swallows don't
grow old
Lucky the Toad
crawl out!
lotus blossom
foggy rain--
let the lilies in the desolate field
bloom!
the bamboo shoots suffer
this crappy world's
storm
the scrawny plum tree
is fruitless too...
my life
Ninth Month--
the sky wears a colorful
kimono
the blooming pink
rallies its spirits...
a cold night
the pink flaunts
a single bloom...
a cold night
people's voices--
in the grove the cold night
isn't
mountain village--
a cold night's
night walker
a chill running
up my spine...
chilly clouds
chilly, chilly
the sun deigns to rise
behind me
yet another traveler
overtakes me...
autumn dusk
children
on autumn's last day...
a ruckus!
taking no notice
of such a moon...
little house
on a soot-grimed
straw mat too...
moon gazing
autumn wind--
a face used to its blast
in his mountain home
behind me
the autumn wind blows
me home
under which star
is my home?
autumn wind
morning-glories shiver
as they sprout...
an autumn gale blows
soon enough
for the murderer too...
dew on the grass
dewdrops forming--
on the hill, of course
smoke rising
dewdrops on the grass
at first so happy!
so cool!
in beads of dew
one by one my home
village
lightning flash--
a rain shower party
for the wild grasses
is that dew
the horse's tears?
autumn mountain
such cool air!
Tanabata clouds
and evening
Tanabata Night--
a single eggplant
standing up
the Boy Star
beams his smile...
through the trees
the sumo champion
and the dawn...
classics
once upon a time
he was the champ...
humble cottage
evening--
the wind also chills
the sumo wrestler
scarecrows standing--
a house without rice cakes
can't be found
the pine saplings
looking pretty...
a scarecrow
facing my way
in the cold rain...
a scarecrow
that farmer
draining his rice field...
lonely too?
the rice field guard
also watches...
water drains away
in Yoshino's
ancient night...
someone pounding cloth
rice field geese--
not a single voice
sounds old
once they settle down
another clamor...
rice field geese
wind is blowing
and so the geese
are honking
geese honking
hasten the evening...
little house
evening wind--
the geese turn around
honking
the day is short
as is the life
of the dragonfly
leaving the morning-glory
songless...
a katydid
over wildflowers
soup steam wafts...
autumn festival
chrysanthemums bloom
with ease...
riverbank
among my pitifully
thatched eaves...
a chrysanthemum
born again
morning-glories make
autumn bloom
morning-glories--
they also aren't tired
of blooming
morning-glories
on the saw scrap heap
bloom
is that dew
the horse's tears?
rice blossoms
even where the puppy
sleeps...
red fallen leaves
a fluffy pillow
for the young buck...
red leaves
oppressed by creepers
roses
of Sharon
roses of Sharon
despite the scolding crows
survive
chestnuts dropping
one by one...

little chestnuts
how often are you
stepped on!
little chestnuts
pissed on by the horse...
shiny new
a frozen bell clangs
on the mountain out back
at bedtime
marking the end
of another year...
snowfall
comparing my wrinkles
with the pickled plums...

come in snail
and live with me...
first winter rain

festooned with red leaves...

on the tree stump...

on me, on the mountain
we take our turns...

blowing in my sleeves...

of my knees...

facing a house
without sake...

here and there
eggplants dangle too...
withered fields
all sorts of fools
moon-gaze too...

ashamed--
eating then going to bed
I hear the winter prayers
all the tea at hand
I unseal...

in Katsushika
they dump soot there too...

don't turn around and look...

sparrows
the plum tree too
is soon snowed in...

over there?
winter seclusion--

till evening
for three months
my winter seclusion...

wild boar--
it looks like you just
woke up
wind blows--
the wild boar's sleeping face
so innocent
trampling my house
to pieces, are you?
flock of plovers
winter hay
and smoke from tea grounds...
sweet nostalgia
why so slow
withering?
little thicket's hedge
lacking good sense
out-of-season flowers
on the fence
even on New Year's Day
around here Edo
is countrified
for the turtle too
it's the First Month
first day
may the gods grant
prosperity!
the emperor's spring
spring begins--
I send up my smoke
like everyone else
at my gate
the artless pigeon too
sings "It's spring!"

rises anciently...
spring begins
with no cards or letters
spring has begun...
thatched house
"Spring's begun"
I say then see
the hole in the wall
today too, today too

the trainer lets
his monkey hold it...

sound of a loom--
hidden in bamboo
a New Year's kite
sleeping through New Year's
dreaming of plum blossoms
probably
it being today
even in a nook of the hedge
picking herbs
appreciating
the falling snow...
picking herbs
the nightingale sings
with a country twang...
springtime
rising over
the swishing grasses...
spring sun

over the swishing grasses
gliding up
for the turtle on a rock
it's the usual
long day
the back gate
opens on its own...

at the man...
a long day
in the owl's opinion
every day
is long

on my narrow sleeves...
clinging

with spring snow
going to see

whistles through...

in spring's breeze
clutching chopsticks

over rice cakes and jelly

blows
misty day--
the meal at the mountain's foot
marvelous
through heat shimmers

rain

has a blast...

is parched

become money
getting used to drinking
the horse's water...

all green
a pheasant cries--
burnt black yesterday
this ancient pine

half-hearted...
spring begins
giving these skinny legs
new life...
a pheasant
geese have gone--
the field's grass chafing
people
the departing goose
drops an enormous
crap
smell the buckwheat
in the thicket!

the traveling geese
check it out thoroughly...

the human heart, too
wanders
from the tub in the reeds

frog
next to my shadow
that
of a frog

the nights becoming
shorter
in leafy shade
an old man's voice...
a frog!
in leafy shade
gazing at the camellia...

"Come see
the crappy house at night!"
croak the frogs
an evening frog
in rainy weeds sings
of old age
at my gate

horse's leg
now and then, sleeps

in the next life don't
be like me

are here
for the poor

growls his distrust...
cherry blossoms!
bells and big drums
all stop...
cherry blossoms

of a Buddhist
simply trust,
simply trust!

is worth a look...

in yellow roses

looking again
looking again...

of dawn have changed
to summer clothes
every time I put on
the summer kimono...

yet he's under his fan
asleep
the rivers have
an ancient darkness...

but weeds

a regular...

making the nightingale
reach old age...

while I'm gone
you and the nightingale are in charge
my snail
fresh green leaves
blowing, blowing...
where I lie
Echigo mountains--
a chill runs up
my spine
a chill runs up
my spine...
Echigo mountains

my spine feels
the mottled mountain
autumn evening--
this is nothing like
my home village
departing clouds--
"Autumn won't return"
the cicadas sing
a glimpse of moon
over my home village...
then clouds
even the moon
over my home village...
brings tears
bright moon--
in a little thicket too
a festival!

the beautiful voice
of the dung-hauler
does it delight
the village child?

on the ancestors' altar
without fail

you saw the bonfires
for the dead?

now and then
a pine breeze...

avoiding the wildflowers
he squats...

and better!

have scattered

also weeps for joy...

the young buck
wipes his wet nose...

drawing near them
a sudden loneliness...

hang there?

blown away
in winter wind

my grave too
will soon need his prayer...

sweeping soot--
even the sparrow's bed
in the thicket
grumble, grumble
the pigeon nags...
no gift of new clothes
the pines of Takasago
laughing...
the year's last day
looking pitiful
in the blighted tree...

today too, today too

are celebrating...

a new spring
and a monkey!
viewed through my cuff
spring's begun--
the sky over my house too
like old times
while I slept

must trust...

on the homecoming servant's
face too...

on the Servants' Holiday
there's no hiding
the white hair

faintly, faintly...

even from my hand's
wrinkles!

on a little brushwood fence
heat shimmers--
yesterday it sang

a snail shell
by Doll Festival time

blooming anywhere

creep along with it...

some stay behind
in the barley...

the nightingale, too
has a merry song...

lose their nests
in the burning grass

covers it
giving shade
for the farmer's plowing...

is enough...

adding themselves
to the bird's nest...

for the nightingale...

is growing old...

ensconced behind
the day flower...

just playing
in round numbers
about three hundred years...

with the vegetable soup
getting used to this blanket
of plum blossom scent...

tucked into folds
of plum blossom scent
I sleep

looks old
the owl
has a connoisseur's face...

"Well then, we'll teach you
how to die..."

singing a song?
blossom shade
among cherry blossoms
not so soldierly...

cherry blossoms--
how long
since olden times?
splish-splash
the sparrow takes
a blossom bath
cherry blossoms scatter--
a nightingale sings
I cry
cherry trees in full bloom--
colds, no doubt
are spreading

and the Tiger's tears...

once again
there's a toll on the bridge...

tomorrow and tomorrow
will they still be?

polished to a shine
by my sweat...
cherry blossoms

goes with his father...

even the rice grinders
stop singing...

cherry blossoms--
to my lowly sleeve
they cling
that they're no good at dying
again can be seen...
cherry blossoms
a soot-grimed
umbrella-hat too...
on cherry blossom day
the cursed cedar
growing fat...
cherry blossoms fall
cherry blossoms scatter--
another day
of life's chaos
under the cherry tree
in bloom
a little gambling shack
rice cakes and jelly--
but too late
cherry blossoms fall
the Buddha too
looks this way...
cherry blossoms!
mountain cherry blossoms--
hair decoration
for a bald man
mountain cherry blossoms--
the pine trees
stand guard
his peach sapling
has blossomed...
though he never prays
the servant returns
and welcoming him home...
peach blossoms
in mosquito territory
the double blossom
yellow roses
yellow rose--
the cultivated grasses
blocking your sun
the yellow rose
wants to hang around...
for the cuckoo
even in little nooks
green willows...
Kyoto
killing a chicken--
the willow at the gate
so green
stitching together
the short summer nights...
croaking frogs
choking off
the cool breeze...
wild roses
drip-drip
goes cool water...
bees have left their hive
even where I sleep
the Fifth Month rain
sends its wind
in the cloudburst
paying no heed...
sleeves of the dancers
summer mountain--
dewdrops in the grass
all shapes and sizes
from the plume grass
the saint's pure water
flows
the blooming pinks
folded over...
pure water
the beehive dangles
heavily above...
pure water
mountain's pure water--
though shaded by trees
it disperses
deigning to guard
the pure water...
a stone Buddha
old weeds--
the festival's breeze
reaches them
paying no heed
to Buddha's birthday...
wildflowers
a wisteria trellis
joins the fray...
Buddha's birthday flowers
growing old
with the early chrysanthemum
paper fan
conducting the choir
of evening's insects...
paper fan
it reaches
the nightingale's bed too...
smudge pot smoke
a four or five foot
yellow rose trembles...
smudge pot smoke
at my humble hut
smoked by mosquito smudge...
wildflowers
dewdrops--
evening's smudge pot smoke
over wildflowers
thin legs--
while cooling myself appraised
by a horsefly
the bats' home
getting on in years...
the post
get a move on, bat!
it's dinnertime
in Kyoto
drinking cheap sake--
this cuckoo
this grove
the nightingale, too
isn't growing old!
mountain sake
from deep inside
the pretty flower...
a mosquito
mosquitoes whine--
even the rustling bamboo
is slandered
a great spot
to hear the cuckoo...
but mosquitoes!
swatting a fly
but hitting
the Buddha
blades of grass--
utterly drenched the cicada
sings
worn by only
a cicada...
cool kimono
for the cicada too
with outstretched legs...
the noon sky
in one village
late-summer bonito
and bright moon
through day flowers
a large woman
makes her way
in day flowers
"Cricky! Cricky!" cricket
sings
day flower--
as red
as the devil's eggplant
day flowers--
even on the smoke-covered
rocks
enjoy the moonflowers
you gods
of the outhouse!
moonflowers--
the pitter-pattering rain
a good luck god
bamboo shoots--
the nightingale brings
her children
peeling a melon
in the plume grass...
a breeze
Ninth Month--
the 29th day
the chrysanthemum blooms
autumn begins--
lying down, looking at
snowy mountains
first autumn morning
the mountain snow's wind
arrives
for the neighing horse
the cold night
same as for me
a pine tree
like none other...
a cold night
against the tree
by the gate a ladder...
a cold night
one and all
faces of the Buddhas
cold tonight
my paper lantern
is snatched away...
a cold night
O snail
how do you make your living?
autumn dusk
the owl is happy
in his solitude...
autumn dusk
with the moon out
it seems to shrink back...
little mountain
no sight yet
of the rising moon...
holy men
Shinano road--
how many nights now
that moon on the eaves?
not looking smoky
through hot spring steam...
face of the moon
under my bottom
the stone warms up...
moonlit night
lit by the harvest moon
no different...
trashy house
autumn heavens--
for one little bird
so vast
trusting its fate
to the autumn wind...
duckweed
in autumn wind
this year's crop...
red leaves
autumn wind--
death draws closer
with every year
through what teeth
I have left
autumn's wind whistles
what do you think
of the silver dew
Mr. Scarecrow?
in the silver dew
I'd like to sow seeds
of plume grass
happily watching
the dewdrops forming...
a frog
stinging bug
you too someday, some time...
dewy grass
the swallow's steady
stare...
lantern for the dead
scarecrows at dusk
darkening...
human faces
stored away
with reverence...
the scarecrow
for people
and for scarecrows
the day ends
despite your cries
young buck
rain falls on the mountain
young buck--
his last cry
thin and long
mountain deer
in bush clover dew...
wash your face!
before the geese
can take their seats...
crows
autumn's first geese
come first
to the poor town
when a lantern comes
the insect breaks out
in song
caged insect--
he's learned to sing
in all this smoke
five or six trembling
rice plants...
my insect cage
the insects' chorus
makes it smaller...
shrine
Buddha and spoons
the whole wide world!
insects singing
Musashi Plain--
in its middle at a inn
an insect cage
singing all
the cool night long...
caged insect
a butterfly emerges
and flies away...
morning moon
hey toad
the caterpillar will grow
and fly away!
he, too, quickly learns
how cold the morning is...
dragonfly
when will it become
a cricket's nest?
my white hair
"The world is good!
Good!" so say
the locusts
not shrinking back
from the sunset...
wildflowers
in grass where the wolf
shed his fur...
wildflowers
wildflowers--
high over people's heads
the bell tolls
out of the grasses
the inevitable
wildflowers!
birds singing--
wild daisies too
are blooming
in the musket's
line of fire...
a maiden flower
decorating the puppy
bush clover
blooms
children play
with the deer
bush clover blooming

the big dog
sound asleep
every evening
not growing old...
blooming bush clover
in one sleeve
the plume grass wind
buffets
the autumn fly's
final sleeping spot...
paulownia leaf
dropping plop!
onto the puppy...
one leaf
after one day
among people...
one leaf left
not a pretty sight
the paulownia leaf
wind-blown
one by one
ignored by people...
mushrooms
a "Praise Buddha!"
pops to my lips...
mushrooms
pines shed their needles--
come mushroom-hunting time
who'll be here?
among the reeds
on the year's last evening...
a wooden drum
standing
in the dying year's sun...
nettle tree
plum tree--
the dumping ground for
Kyoto's soot
bamboo soot-broom--
the horse's head too
by and by
bamboo soot-broom--
the first nightingale's
singing spot
sweeping soot
the sun sets in peace...
vegetable field
sweeping soot--
plum blossoms at the gate
indifferent
in the tree's shade
pounding rice cakes
for Amida Buddha
pounding rice cakes--
in Kyoto all chickens
are awake
in a Sumiyoshi nook
growing a year older...
sea gulls
despised
by the barrier guard...
a plover sings
cornerstone--
on New Year's morning
a bird without a nest
on New Year's Day
I have company
bird without a nest
on New Year's Day
a balancing act in her sleep...
pretty woman
less and less First Month
as nights pass by...
mist
missing the boat
for First Month...
spring breeze
morning's laugh--
"How much do they cost,
spring's blossoms?"
now with homeless eyes
I see it...
blossoming spring
for this homeless body
of mine, spring's
first day
homecoming servant--
pretending the persimmon
is sweet
homecoming servant--
the paulownia tree too
grew up fast
in the mop's
drying place...
my New Year's pine
making charcoal balls
one by one...
a long day
in the long day
passing with mouth wide...
a crow
at spring's last night
the owl
is nagging
paying no attention
to the departing spring...
crows
the little shrine
is all azaleas...
spring rain
today too
looking at the same mountain...
spring rain
spring rain--
mud-dumplings too
gifts from afar

better than the flowers of others
my little thicket
the spring breeze
blows all evening too...
Higashi Mountains
spring breeze--
drying in the grass
a paper dog
spring wind--
even in the pillar's hole
pollen
spring breeze--
on a night journey to see
Higashi Mountains
spring breeze--
even at night a market stand
on Naniwa Bay
accusing the pine
of foolishness...
evening mist
to my window
he comes as usual...
thin mist
the evening bath
slish-slosh...
mist
it's my umbrella-hat
don't run, geese!
first mist
in heat shimmers
the vines people loathe...
beautiful
heat shimmers--
yesterday it wasn't there
tea-and-dumpling shop
snow melting--
for sparrows at the gate
good as a harvest moon!
snow melting--
at the gate the sparrows'
New Year's bash!
"I'm the first
of the migrating servants!"
a crow
umbrella-hat and skirt
in the evening...
threshing tea leaves
a plowman facing
sunset...
Mount Tsukuba
at dawn

cries for love
the lover cat
dandied up like Genji
at the fence
settling into
the penny toss hole...

chasing the crow
ten or twelve yards...

baby sparrow
inside a person's fist
its first cry
fledgling faces
peek out the nest...

hushes to listen...
tea-picking song
accompanying the rain
with its tail...
a pheasant
seeing off
the departing geese...
little pines
an auspicious
twenty fifth day...
the geese depart
traveling geese
my lake is crossed
in no time
a butterfly flits
as if wanting nothing
in this world
butterflies flitting--
pretty little bamboo shoots
shooting up
nothing else blooming
but rape...
my hut
wisteria trellis--
behind it, in the light
wildflowers
plum blossom scent--
I tell you spring
is a night thing
the plum tree
where the stray cat carouses
in bloom
my home village--
even in summer
plum trees bloom
plum blossom scent--
the edict board furnished
with sacred sake
simply trust!
cherry blossoms flitting
down
cherry blossoms scatter--
bad Buddhists
carousing
cherry blossoms!
country nightingales
country candy
one cherry tree
has kept blooming...
the corrupt world
secluded house--
the cherry blossoms late
the bonito...late
a windy place!
but one cherry tree
in bloom
fifty years
of gazing, gazing...
cherry blossoms
in a Sumiyoshi nook
blooming
cherry blossoms
simply trust!
cherry blossoms fall
pit-a-pat
even the frog's eyes
can't turn away...
cherry blossoms!
green with envy--
blooming cherry trees
little house
the old cherry tree
blooming
till it drops
mountain cherry blossoms--
in all 88
sacred sites
my mean peach tree
nice and chubby
with blossoms
peach tree in bloom--
but first a prayer
for the dewy barley
green willows--
at ten different holes
gamblers tossing pennies
rustling
in Goddess Kannon's heart...
the willow
planting a willow--
someday, in summer
who'll enjoy its cool air?
again there is splendor
beyond the gate...
willow tree
coming now
is it a Kiso cloudburst?
Mount Asama
under the cloudburst
standing tall...
lamps in the grove
in the cloudburst
there's not a gate
without a pink
extending from my pillow
in the downpour...
plume grass
every evening
"Rain is coming!"
cloud watchers
night festival--
a big cloudburst
strolls through
in the pine breeze
the saint's pure water
flows
raising it for
my summer seclusion's view...
little pine
a praying mantis
at the base of Mount Fuji
clings
it's Mount Fuji's grass
but no trace
of cool air
no Mount Fuji
I can almost straddle
this year
let's thatch with irises--
Mount Asama's smoke
looks calm
swallows return
on the day eaves are thatched
with irises
from the mountain
I see my own gate...

pit-a-pat pearls
of sweat drip down...

rustic
watching the whiteness
of summer kimonos...

a boor with the ladies
but he puts one on...

tomorrow night and the next
the same?
in my mosquito net, alone
stopping to count
my mosquito net's holes...
sickle moon
high noon--
inside the mosquito net
wildflowers blooming
stroke victim--
even holding a paper fan
an ordeal
smoking out mosquitoes--
soon the fireflies
are gone too
veiling the face
of the evening moon...

for singing cuckoos...

and three or four
fireflies
a softly blowing
world-improving breeze...
fireflies flit
into my pitiful kettle
one by one...
fireflies
"Come, fireflies!"

makes my night
sparkling fireflies--
even the frog's mouth
gapes

fireflies dampen
the thin tatami mat
the pesky mosquito's
birthplace...
temple flower
do you also miss
your mother?

of new bamboo...

to the weeds!

to burst

"Surely the mushrooms
are this way!"
"This way
to the mushrooms!"

one by one--
even the mouse's hole
has mushrooms
it suits me--
even the former owner's
winter cold
first snowfall--
what are you praying for

will I be the next one
you caw over?

a ruckus of trout
"Be brave, cherry blossoms
and fall!"

darting to the rhythm
of blossoms falling...

for death!"

he's hated
by the young folk...

I've waited long
for thee

cheered on
by a reed thrush

seems to be hooting
for fireflies

with a rice bag on his head
he passes
the winter fly
I spare, the cat
snatches
on people
and on pufferfish
the same moon shines
beggars under a bridge
give it a toss...
pufferfish
presenting itself
to Musashi Plain...
the pufferfish
wrap it in straw
or it'll show...
face of the pufferfish
wrapped in straw--
of course! a pufferfish
and plum blossoms
winter trees--
an old sound
from olden times
let the fleeing people
alone!
red leaves falling
up to today
still no decision to scatter?
out-of-season blooms
moon! blossoms!
forty-nine years walking around
a waste
"moon" and "blossoms"
empty babble
of a floating world
even for the tongue-tied
crow of the east...
spring's first dawn
the baby given chopsticks
digs in...
spring's first morning
well, well...
now I've seen fifty
blossoming springs
amazing to reach
my fiftieth year...
blossoming spring
spring begins--
no reed mat over my head
fifty years now
spring begins--
at least I'm human
fifty years now
spring begins--
the Future Buddha in ten more
Years of the Dragon
creating a pretty
spring...
the evening rain
to the same world
one after another...
temple coin souvenirs
just a foot long
but it'll do...
New Year's pine
a crossroads sermon
gibberish
spring peace
spring peace--
in the great courtier's hem
dust
all of a sudden
he shuts up...
crow
in the long day
they eat, they don't eat
pond turtles
the field crow
slips so cleverly...
spring rain
even the field mouse
squeaks, "What luck!"
spring rain
in spring rain
with a paper lantern...
little beauty
potted tree--
I blow a spring breeze on you
again today
spring breeze--
the pleasure quarter's
night life
spring breeze--
over the game stones
ten at a time
spring wind--
my thatched roof
blown flat
spring breeze--
where my feet are pointed
I'm on my way
spring breeze--
when did you come out
noon moon?
long and narrow
the spring breeze blows...
gentle slope
turtle shells
blown into a row...
east wind
spring mist--
the place where money trees
are planted
on a misty day
they chat...
horses in the field
misty day--
no doubt Heaven's saints
bored stiff
an old temple bell
and voices too
muffled in mist
the old bowl
quickly misted over...
Sumida River
even the wheat
in a morning mood...
blue mist
imitating me
the good-for-nothing mountain
in the mist
old pine
starting a new year...
how many spring mists?
out of mist
one by one they come...
Kan-ei Temple
the night guest's lamp
in mist...
temple in a field
heat shimmers--
how the cat talks
in her sleep!
in heat shimmers
covering the rice...
crows
heat shimmers--
the lackey turns to look
behind him
the little tavern
open for business...
spring mountain
brushed by her sleeves
every mountain
is greening!
herb cakes--
when did you get here
little butterfly?
even tossing rice
is a sin...
sparring chickens
blue skies
nothing but blue skies...
low tide
picking herbs--
the fox's hole gets
a "Hello!"
the village child
picking herbs, reveals
a foxhole
monkey on the monkey
watches...
the burning field
planting one
pine sapling...
my grandchild's face
snatched
by the spoonbill...
the grafted branch
the mountain crow
laughs at the branch
I grafted
mountain crow--
he sees my grafted tree
and laughs
cats' love calls--
between them flows
Sumida River
the Edo cat
in a frenzy...
Sumida River
jumping so well
over the fire...
the love-crazed cat
Musashi Plain--
just one house
one love-crazed cat
parent sparrows
baby sparrows...
a happy mountain
baby sparrow--
his face unaware
of his parents' fights
are you the nightingale's
only daughter
behind the others, singing?
nightingale--
his face doesn't look
like a big shot's
lining up
with newcomers' faces...
swallows
at the little gambling shack
the swallow
prattles
lovely--
the sky after a lark
has sung
lovely--
the sky where a noon lark
is singing
come down! come down!
brushfires have started...
singing lark
today too, today too
over in the bamboo
a lark sings
missing people
by two or three feet...
skylarks
seeing the inn's
inner garden, the lark
sings
down a narrow alley
the ocean...
a singing lark
the mountain man's
hoe is his pillow...
singing lark
a pheasant
loitering about, peeks
in my gate
crying pheasant, pounding mill
morning till noon
at the temple
crying pheasant--
swallow the Eight Provinces
in a gulp!
the pheasant cries
as if catching sight
of a mountain
a pheasant rushing
to the mountain, missing
his darling wife
the green willow too
tires of watching...
departing geese
departing geese--
human beings miss them
terribly
after the geese depart
back to normal...
Sumida River
in the Karasaki pine
jet black...
a frog
in grassy shade
the frog's wife also lives
in seclusion
get ready to see
my piss waterfall!
croaking frog
brazenly squatting
on the tatami mat...
a frog
in every direction
ten thousand blessings...
croaking frogs
taking flight
and a leak...
croaking frog
crossing the bridge
behind the blind man...
a frog
paying a visit
to the flower's root...
a frog
one foot
on the butterbur leaf...
croaking frog
the yellow rose's
honorable ally...
a frog
scowling
at the evening sky...
a frog
next to evening's Mount Fuji
his butt...
croaking frog
wake up! wake up!
sparrows, butterflies
are dancing
don't be lazy!
sparrows, butterflies
are dancing
making their living
butterfly couples...
three...five!
the poop scooper
utterly smeared...
with butterflies
little straw mat--
Bodhidharma, butterfly
and sparrows
clinging to
the boar hunter's arm...
little butterfly
one came
and two left...
garden butterflies
the butterfly
and the deer, best
of friends
butterfly dances
'round the arrow
in a dying deer
three feet
from the musket's barrel...
little butterfly
temple mountain--
a baby tumbles
a butterfly flits
from dawn to dusk
the butterfly couple
makes their living
a green lawn--
come have a seat
Sir Pond Snail!
little tub--
pond snails ready for shelling
play sliding games
making no fuss
they are captured...
pond snails
pond snails sing
they're in the kettle
but don't know it
sound asleep
there is peace on earth...
pond snail
Mokubo Temple--
a blossom-viewing pond snail
and Mount Tsukuba
a pretty thing
on the beggarly vine...
buds
following the times
even my hut's grasses
so young!
new grass--
at the town's back door
Mount Fuji
croaking frogs--
"Mustard in the ditch
has bloomed!"
in the flowering mustard
Kazusa-style
"Praise Buddha!"
in the flowering mustard
well, well
the great god Inari!
beyond the gate
of flowering mustard...
Sumida River
at the edge
of the flowering mustard...
Mount Fuji
Praise Buddha!
my little side-field
has bloomed with rape
flimsily
the beggar's mustard flowers too
have bloomed
like they're calling
to the nightingale...
the bracken
plum in bloom--
a beggar's blossoms too
next door
on his scrap of mat
four or five pennies...
plum blossoms
in the field
of the Buddha of Misfortune
plum blossoms!
though they bloomed
they're not much to look at...
plum blossoms
in hell's mirror
the plum-blossom thief's
reflection
brother, look!
Sakubei's shop has
plums
coins clattering
he thanks them politely...
plum blossoms
at the end of the money-
begging rope...
plum blossoms
in the woods where
a wild boar was spotted...
plum blossoms
an uproar 'round
the penny toss hole...
blossom shade
spreading as far
as Hokkaido...
Buddha's law and blossoms
squirming
through the cherry blossoms...
people
in scattering blossoms
Buddha and Buddhism
unknown
scattering cherry blossoms--
thirsty for that faraway
mist
year after year
the sin of blossoms...
wrinkled now
bloom, cherry trees!
Buddha's law spreads
to Hokkaido
in this world
over hell...
viewing spring blossoms
stepchild cherry blossoms--
not stunted
at all
where they dug up
the blooming cherry tree
the wind blows
second day
at market, drying up...
cherry blossoms
like they fell
from heaven...
cherry blossoms
the month's
Mr. Ten and Mr. Nine...
cherry blossoms
he's a mountain
cherry blossom-crazed
old man
as soon as it bloomed
they dug up
the cherry tree
yellow roses--
a horse tied
to an old Jizo
dangling
in the yellow roses
the bull's balls
Sixth Month--
the brutal heat
is no more
over my head
a Sixth Month night
of moon
summer's early dawn--
dwindling night reveals
a willow
nighttime in Edo
is especially short...
it seems
nights growing shorter
a delight...
sweet nostalgia
all the short summer night
hard at work puffing...
Mount Asama
short summer night--
little puff-ball flowers
have bloomed
"The summer night
so brief, so brief!"
people and blossoms agree
a hot day's treasure
they say, little clump
of trees
the beards of millet
in good health...
such heat!
herons in a row--
everywhere the same
cool breeze
trailing behind
the cool air...
the month's last day
summer cool--
the puffy clouds
like handballs
when evening falls
the willows of Edo
chill
old age--
even the cool moon
soon grows tiresome
a crab pinches
the leaf of a reed--
Fifth Month rain
Sakamoto--
thatched huts, thatched huts
and Fifth Month rain
Fifth Month rain--
not a rock
without azaleas
Mr. Toad--
the Fifth Month rains
have begun!
the bagworm
has strong karma...
Fifth Month rain
just three raindrops
and they call it
"A stormy night!"
just three raindrops
"A cloudburst!
A cloudburst!"
rainstorm--
at the edge of the sea
it starts
in the cloudburst
a crane-tortoise-pine-bamboo
attitude
touching the head
of the raining cloud...
plume grass
the cloudburst's
target...
teahouse in a field
the cloudburst's
answer to sunlight...
a night sky
like he's snapping
at the downpour...
gargoyle
standing in the cloudburst
keeping her cool...
maiden flower
rainstorm--
a poor sake bottle
rolls along
the cloud mountain
behind one blade of grass
vanishes
the peaks of clouds
hiding
in the grass
festival day--
even the little clouds
forming peaks
don't run away
from the sickle moon
billowing clouds!
Musashi Plain--
the flea also heads
for the peaks of clouds
Kisa Lagoon--
a summer moon worthy
of Noin
the goddess of spring's
child, come out too!

becomes a butterfly...

the door opens
to Naniwa Bay...

as a flawless night
guarded by the goddess
Kannon...

come, sparrows!
praise Buddha's
compassionate saints!
pure water
my home village--
even behind the outhouse
pure water gushes
come nightfall
it still gushes diligently...
pure water
in the cogon grass
it rustles again...

rustle-rustle
nibbling on a rice dumpling...
a pretty woman
clamorous cormorants
see in the New Year
too
granny's cormorant too
celebrates the third day
of First Month
for the geese and ducks
of this world...
new summer robes
even no-good me
somehow pulls it off...
a new summer robe
the morning willow
is first...
a new summer robe
chanting "Praise Buddha!"
changing into
my summer robe
in the beggar's town, too
in thicket shade
new summer robe

through my summer kimono shining
moon in the pine
a catfish caught
in a gourd...

like blue sky
the summer kimono
I'm wearing
a kimono for a sail
rushing along...

printed small
on the summer kimono

like a felled tree
in his summer kimono...
big man

cut to show shins...

in the deep heart
of the tall bamboo...

my home village--
from inside my mosquito net
I watch

at full bloom...

shading my eyes
with Saigyo's Mount Fuji...

a gift
from the god of the poor...

at my side...

the cool breeze
night after night--
even the beggarly vine
enjoys the cool air
hey nightingale
what blooms at the icehouses
of Edo?
in my palm
next to one of my lice...

prayers drown you out...
cuckoo!
mountain country--
why do you dislike it
cuckoo?
the boat departs--
right next to his head
a cuckoo
to our ears
just a lot of noise...
the cuckoo
a mountain cuckoo sings
"Don't fall off
that horse!"
looking down at the village
of white walls
mountain cuckoo
just one reed
for the reed thrush...
Sumida river
hey reed thrush--
it's four or five inches tall
Mount Tsukuba
a reed thrush--
Mount Tsukuba
in a corner of the sky
to the rhythm
of a moorhen's cries...

mocking Mokubo Temple's
prayer gong...

of grass beckons...

kept as pets
by citizens of Edo...

by the dog...

over the crunch-crunch
of my eating...
a firefly flits
"Don't bump your head
on that stone!"
flitting firefly
fly away, firefly
my hut's smoky!

called forth
by Mr. Long-Beard...

a mouth calling fireflies--
one
flies in
evening falls--
to the just-sold grass
fireflies flit
one cocoon
in the stone Buddha's
lap
beyond the swarming
mosquitoes, the no-good
nettle tree
one mosquito
flies down my throat...
an uproar!
my hut's fleas
how cute!
they sleep with me
a flea jumps
in the laughing Buddha's
mouth
evening--
in a big sake cup
moon and a flea

the red leaf flutters
down
"first cicada!"
he says
while it pisses
cooling his butt
toward the lake...

in the cicada's direction...

with hoarse voices

from the thin curve
of the sickle moon...

pushing up through
seven feet of millet...

to my open palms
snowflakes flitting
down
softly, softly
blanketed with snow...
my residence
on my thin legs
smack! smack!

secluded house--
sweeping soot
off the dog's head, too
harvest moon--
so much soot to sweep
at Zenko Temple

at a Sumida River inn
"Come and get
your boar stew!"
Sumida River inn
were you born
Tenth Month, tenth day?
wren
as evening falls
in Nihonbashi, a chorus
of plovers
slapping the big
chrysanthemum's face...
falling leaf
fallen leaves--
not a single crow
is irksome
even newborn leaves
turned red...
fall like tears
on purple clouds
when will I set sail?
western sea
what a shame!
how many canes prop you up
old pine?
a five-inch nail--
the pine tree
is weeping
not yet Buddha--
the mindless old
pine
in pine-tree shade
sleeping, eating...
sixty provinces!
even for bamboo
there's nothing but
crookedness
bamboo grove--
here, too, there's no
perfection
a thousand years
until the next life?
Mr. and Mrs. Crane
at my hut too
holding a child, listening...
evening crane
are your thousand years
ending today?
song of the crane
maybe water's boiling
in the big kettle...

and how old are you
Mr. Turtle?

with a thump, thump
the turtle drags
along
carry me off too
wherever you like...

born in the pines
of Matsushima...

every time...
deep inside
of everyone, Mount Asama's
smoke
First Month--
instead of plum blossoms
a blizzard
no customary
New Year's Day
for the slob
blossoms--
from this morning on
29 springs to go
joining
the brushwood fire's smoke
morning's blossoms
with gums for grinders
greeting the blossoming
spring
just when my house
has gotten used to deep snow...
spring blossoms
do not think me
a poor-spirited soul...
mankind's spring
a world of plum blossoms
and willows!
mankind's spring
Mankind's Day--
but nothing special
in my rice gruel
back from holiday
the servant brings a friend...
Kyoto
Servants' Holiday--
the great festival shrine
passes by
joining the travelers
on Servants' Holiday...
a huge man
a servant on holiday
behind me says a prayer...
Mount Matchi
lucky beans
and lucky tea
just for me alone
spring at my gate--
the first New Year's greeting
from sparrows
a Kyoto suburb--
even flying kites
is hard
even the beggar
hopes to get rich...
god of wealth singers
a beggar's New Year's song
too
in the mist
one leaf
for the nightingale...
New Year's herbs
dirty nails
facing my New Year's dish
ashamed
blatantly the snow
falls pit-a-pat...
spring peace
the lame chicken
dragging, dragging...
a long day
to the beat
of a pheasant's cries
spring dusk
hey spear holder!
don't let the spring
escape!
small talk
down in the cellar...
spring rain
first thing after waking up
spring rain
in my eyes
letting her parent carry
the paper lantern...
spring rain
spring rain--
the uneaten ducks
are quacking
spring rain--
a mouse licking up
Sumida River
in one boat
a horse rides too...
spring rain

of a pestle

has passed away

over blossoms...

coming down
to eat his lunch...

in leaves of grass
playing hide-and-seek...

chin-deep
in the fallen blossoms...

in his retreat
in the flowering mustard

in olden times?

a lucky day
sticking, sticking
to paper umbrellas...
cherry blossoms
lining the bottom
of the trash can...
cherry blossoms
the cherry blossoms fall--
I apologize to a dog
in passing
cherry blossoms
I waited and waited for...
I'm alone
while viewing mountain
cherry blossoms...
a prayer
evening cherry blossoms
to the prayer gong's beat
scatter
from willow tree
from plum tree comes
the fox!
from the willow
a ghost attacks!

for a god
lying spread-eagle
cool
lonely
nothing at all
but a calm heart
and cool air

cheer for the cloudburst
I bring
blessings fall
on Mount Togakushi...
a cloudburst
little straw mat--
the cloudburst just a spurt
but a good one
perfectly round
the cloud's first
burst
taking the cloudburst's
place
just teardrops
a bowl to catch
the cloudburst...
my hut
a summer rainstorm--
scratches
my itch
a good omen--
in the west, deep red
billowing clouds
on the tips
of my outstretched toes...
billowing clouds

thinks to reach them...

forming vain peaks
in vain

green! green!

of Morito's face...

wears a straw hat...
falling sleet
the gatekeeper sweeps
a pile with his foot...
sleet
up to my doorway
so quickly the fields
have withered
at dawn by the plum tree
there's one too...

Great Japan!
a bird recites a sutra
a monk beats a bowl
admirable!
he beats the gourd
non-stop

too

at the edge of the hearth
their pillows

is swept

I go through the motion
of sweeping it

gets swiped

I bow to plum blossoms
and camellias

in the shade
of the rice cake flower...

tucking into my futon
just like Dharma
I sit
tucking into my futon
tomorrow's straw sandals
by the pillow

just like Dharma
in my futon
waking up
to a row of dolls...
my futon

I'm a great hero!
in my previous life
good seeds were sown...
my cozy brazier!
on a clear morning
the coal fire in a crackling
mood
more than enough
for Priest Issa...
one bag of coal
morning's charcoal fire--
the mountain's pine breeze
wafting by
whether upright
or crooked it's the same...
charcoal fire
my pestle, too
for pounding charcoal
has grown old

over his shoulder...

to Mount Hakone

with a pale blue
sky
with that moon
and its halo...

it's become a moonlit
night of spring
at evening
like washed-out ink...
the year's first sky
a drab color
but it's the year's
first sky!
facing fences--
just three feet wide
the year's first sky
among the pines
just a piece of it but still...
the year's first sky!

in patches between trees

praying the New Year's god
will heal my weak foot...

at my farmhouse...

palms...
in careful bits
another thing of this floating world...
weighing charcoal
a cozy wood fire--
the high priest also
takes a seat
even breaking firewood
with my knee...
a feat
though night is pitch black
the banked fire
works fine
painted fan's prostitute
laugh at me too!
taking medicine
why so restless
restless, restless?
little wren
it's your big day
the 30th of Ninth Month!
wren
a wren
on the dog's prowling route
creeps
little wren
in falling rain drenched
to the bone
here and there
in little meetings...
plovers
going out to piss
for the hundredth time...
plovers in the night
bright moon--
the plovers all buried
in the house's thatch
what a huge convocation!
plovers
on the beach
is the falling snow
medicine for your voices
plovers?
with red leaves
on their heads, the waterfowl
asleep
chrysanthemums, too
in the withering mix...
temple road
even the grasses
that stab people
clumsily wither
withered grassland--
once upon a time there was
a she-demon...
a battle royal
with radishes...
children
in fallen leaves
the crow who respects
his parents
burying the latrine
of the lover cat...
fallen leaves
without you--
the grove
is just a grove
oh gods
this year again I pray...
two children, please?
though it's First Month
twenty days
in my winter coat
First Month--
even at the outcaste's porch
plum blossoms
First Month--
tonight a night
of plum blossom moon
crawl and laugh--
from this morning on
a two year old!
at my feet
a bird springs up
with the spring!
new spring
Yataro dies, priest Issa
is born
spring has sprung--
a one-day, two-day
sickle moon
with millet dumplings
a peaceful spring
rolls in
morning's raindrops trace
the wrinkles of my hands...
year's first day
in the storehouse
the hoe glinting...
year's first dawn
at my hermitage
it starts at noon...
the year's first day
year's first sunrise--
even the hoe
gets a prayer
we follow our feet
to the village...
our New Year's walk
nightingale--
through a half-folded folding door
my New Year's walk
a big snow--
the exit tunnel
is my lucky direction
deep in Saga--
my New Year's walk
follows holes made by canes
edge of a field--
my New Year's walk
follows holes made by canes
lit by the New Year's
shelf...
the hoe's halo
New Year's shelf--
from a dark nook
a lucky mouse
my hut--
it's a crooked path
to the New Year's shelf
hauled up
in the bamboo basket...
a sparrow!
Little New Year's--
and the moon has deigned
to rise!
Little New Year's
on the First Month's
15th day

and a New Year's snow
coming down

sucking on
the eternal youth ornament...

hide-and-seek...

Karasaki--
even from the New Year's pine

decorated with pine
beyond the reach
of the red horse's mouth...

a New Year's wreath
for the crossroads Buddha's
head

even from the quince hedge
"Happy New Year!"

from across the river
"Happy New Year!"

with muddy straw sandals...

even from the quince thicket
"Happy New Year!"

greedily using up
the year's first water...
the woman

sparrows in a row
with healthy faces
year's first water--
the first goes to Buddha's
bucket of branches
the dog chewing
the shuttlecock
comes running along
the shuttlecock reaches
its edge...
crescent moon
age of the gods!
even for me a square
of zoni
though we say
"Happy New Year!"
zoni for only two
Mount Fuji dawn--
a New Year's sake toast
at my lips
barrier gate--
a New Year's sake toast
to Mount Fuji
a New Year's toast
on his shaved head...
he goes forth
beaten out
by the women...
picking herbs
two or three leaves
then calling it quits...
picking herbs
the sickle moon
curls up, winter's cold
returns
a long day--
here too everyone's
curled asleep
a long day--
his account book serves
as a pillow
"It's a foolishly long
day!"...the crow opens
his mouth
the day is devilishly
long!
long!

is a mess
possessed
by the heat shimmers...

walking along he preaches
his sermon

among grasses of the eaves

costs money
in the big river

in a perfect square
flows away

boldy he forecasts
the moon's
full eclipse
in a flash
the moon's sickness
is cured
returning to us
the great harvest moon!

wanes
before the moon does--
people's faces
wane

of harvest moon
to the world of man

to return

suffers!

is a dewdrop world
yes... but...

flickers
in the lightning flash
rubbing his head...

chased away
from the village of people...

in the cold
"A starling from the sticks!"
he taunts...
how cold it is

beats his bowl
in the box
four or five pennies...

rain
"A starling from the sticks"
I'm called...

yet she chants winter prayers
nonetheless
one by one

of rice cake pounding
to my gate
he seemed to be coming...
neighbor with rice cakes
burdening my child's
back...
rice cakes for the neighbors
stop pestering!

on willow branches
all alone

but gets his share...

and this world's demons
should flee

for a coin...

catching sight of me
he hits his gong

lazy--
leaving blossoms and moon
for tomorrow
which one of those
tame cranes
will the arrow hit?
don't want to see it
don't want to, still...
there's my house!
don't want to remember it
or see it, still
there's my house!

mosquito larvae
dance in memoriam...
the tomb's puddle
mosquito swarms--
from the dog's butt
and head
men of leisure--
"Mosquitoes have come!"
they say
chasing the fly swarm
with his mouth...
dog at the gate
even the old cow
has a fly-whisking
tail
the old hand
swats a fly
already gone
gaping mouthed
and fly-hungry...
dog at the gate
my clean-shaven head--
the flies
stomp on it
temple fly mimic--
hands
praying beads
after the fly swarm
escapes, swat!
my wrinkled hand
don't swat the fly!
rubbing hands
rubbing feet
trudging along
enduring his fleas...
country cat
in the lake
heading for the mountain...
the flea swims
my home--
next door to a thicket
of fleas
are you watching
the puppy's dream?
cicada singing at night
chirring as he climbs
cicada on the lacquered
post
so many cicadas
so many raindrops from the eaves!
great temple hall
temple in the thicket--
even at night, now and then
cicada song
some sing all night
some eat knotweed...
a matter of taste
verandah flower--
making a skillful turn
a snail
the snail does just
as he pleases...
curled asleep
having a siesta
on Gensei's fence...
a snail
little snail, no different
asleep
awake
straw fence--
coming down skillfully
a snail
coming out
to a hot world, earthworm's
prosperity
in my ramshackle hut
she holds her head high...
the peony
in the pitiful garden
no pitiful
peonies!
why did the blooming
pink break?
oh why?
in something's shadow
slyly blooming...
little pink
so lightly
on the duckweed
the frog's picnic
duckweed--
even blooming in a bucket
wind-rustled
Sir Mouse
nimbly, nimbly crosses
the duckweed
barley husking--
in the middle of the highway
a bright moon
in holy Jizo's
lap, eyes, nose...
blooming moss
undented
by the cat's nap...
moss blossoms
even the roof's moss
blooms
then scatters
house's ridge-pole--
the crow flings down
moss blossoms
evening shadows--
even the poorly growing
moss has bloomed
the old priest
picks off the dust...
moss blossoms
blocking the light
of the back window...
this year's bamboo
the young bamboo's
peak of youth, too
soon passes
scratching the face
of a bamboo shoot...
cat's shadow
kindly guarding
the bamboo shoots...
holy Jizo
upside-down buckets
stand in a row...
fresh green leaves
charcoal cinders
dry on the eaves...
fresh new leaves
a man of leisure
lazily sprawls...
shadow of new leaves
cat on the fence
bucket on the eaves...
fresh green leaves
fresh new leaves--
the cat and the crow
quarrel
the fresh new leaves
happy and well...
Muen Temple
the holy man
grabs a siesta...
grove of summer trees
rain shower--
the grave's shikimi branches, too
are summer trees
making straw sandals
while selling them...
deep tree shade
deutzia blossoms
light up
my cotton-padded lap
deutzia blossoms
on all four corners...
farmhouse at dusk
deutzia blossoms
on all four corners...
headman's house at dusk
deutzia in bloom
the children make
mud-dumplings
sprinkled into
great Edo...
red plums
handled and squeezed
Edo's plums
turn red
the little tub's fish
announce...
"It's autumn's first morning!"
moon at the gate--
as the heat dwindles
so do companions
in morning's cold
wiping even the head
of the stone
morning cold--
a wipe of the cleaning rag
for the gate's stone
morning cold--
bloated with tea, visiting
seven temples
even holy Jizo
bewitches people...
autumn dusk
autumn evening--
a sound to split trees even
evening cloth-pounding
autumn evening--
even for beggar-town
festival guests
haul some night water
to my rice field...
Milky Way!
the half-asleep crow
raises a ruckus...
Milky Way
Fukagawa--
an oyster shell mountain
and autumn's moon
remote village--
the Bon Festival moon
postponed
the paper door
gets a scrubbing...
Bon Festival moon
roasting millet
till it's charred...
Bon Festival moon
"tomorrow night
the harvest moon!"
old man's promise
not swatting horseflies
not swatting bees...
moon gazing
this here mountain
will have to do...
tonight's moon
after a second piss
right away...
moon gazing
taking a seat
on the pine's branch...
moon gazing
on the pine tree's
tippy-top...
moon gazing
harvest moon--
plum and cherry tree
blossoms return!
harvest moon-gazing
priests, samurai
merchants
harvest moon--
digging in the teacup
for sake money
harvest moon--
the peddler selling
eight-penny sake
harvest moon--
some are stretched out
some praying
firewood piles
one... two...
Ninth Month moon
the morning-glories bloom
a second time!
Ninth Month moon
the moon's face
